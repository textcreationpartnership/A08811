            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>OF thoſe that ſeparate from the Church of God, there are many ſorts: Though the Browniſts aſſume vnto themſelves the title of Separation, and call themſelves the
<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. Smyth, Differences, Title. Hen. Ainſvv. Defence againſt Mr. Sm. p. 1.</note> Churches of the Separation, yet is not this title ſufficient to diſtinguiſh them; Separation being common to ſo many.</p>
            <p>Of the Browniſts alſo there are ſundry ſects: Some
<note n="b" place="margin">Chriſtian plea, pa. 216. 217.</note> ſeparate from the Church of England for corruptions; and yet confeſſe both it &amp; Roome alſo to be a true Church, as the followers of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon: Some
<note n="c" place="margin">Iuſtific. p. 339. 340. 247.</note> renounce the Church of England as a falſe Church; and yet allow
<note n="d" place="margin">Relig. com. p. 1, etc.</note> private communion with the godly therein, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon and his followers: Some
<note n="e" place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poy. pag. 197.</note> renounce all Religious communion both publique and private with any member of that Church whoſoever, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth and ſuch as hearken vnto him, being deepeſt and ſtiffeſt in their Schiſme. The evil of this ſeparation is great: Firſt, the mindes of many are troubled and diſtracted hereby; even of ſuch as do not ſeparate, but have ſome liking thereof; eſpecially if it be true which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon writes of them, to wit; that they
<note n="f" place="margin">Relig. comm. prefac. *iij.</note> ſeing it not to be for their purpoſes, that the world ſhould ſo eſteem of them, do vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſtreyn and wring the neck of their conſciences and courſes, to look the contrary way, &amp;c. VVhat can be more miſerable then to have the neckes of conſciences thus broken by the doctrine of ſeparation? Secondly, for thoſe that ſeparate but do not yet joyne vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or being joyned do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from actual communion, living alone and hearing the word of God in no Church, as ſome do; how great is their miſerie alſo? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 36.—39.</note> ſhewes it at large, noting them to be Idol-members, ſuch as break the commandement of Chriſt, looſe the fruit of his aſcenſion, and fayl their own edification and ſalvation many wayes, &amp;c. Thirdly, for thoſe that being joyned vnto them do alſo live with them, ſeing they have in effect excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themſelves from all other Churches of Chriſt, and conſequently from the fellowſhip of Chriſt Ieſus himſelf and from the participation of his grace and glory ſo far as he reveales the ſame by dwelling in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: It is therfore no wonder to heare Mr. Iohnſon
<note n="h" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. A. 2.</note> complayning of the evilles among them, as Emulation, debate and other ſins which dayly ariſe &amp; ſpread themſelves to the great diſhonour of God, &amp;c. Fourthly, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and greater evilles into which they are given up; it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that three or four hundred of the Browniſts have brought forth more Apoſtate Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Arians ſometimes in one yeare then ten thouſand members of the Reformed Dutch Church in this citie, have done in ten yeares or more, though tempted and compaſſed about with ſeducers as much as any other. And this I may juſtly witneſſe for the time of my abode in this
<note n="%" place="margin">Amſterda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> place, where I have ordinarily bene preſent in the Claſſical aſſemblies, and ſeene the number of ſuch as have fallen away, ſo far as is knowne vnto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hereof. And many other are the ſcandalles of this ſchiſme, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them without &amp; againſt the Reformed Churches whoſe communion they diſclayme.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth in his writings againſt me doth very often appeale vnto and call for the Iudgement of the Reader; herein I agree with him and do therfore alſo publiſh &amp; preſent theſe things vnto the view of Chriſtian Readers: and have devided his laſt writing into Sections, not leaving out (to my knowledge) any one of his words; for their help that would compare things together, and ſo judge the more perfectly. The God of all grace bleſſe theſe weak endevours to the praiſe of his holy name and comfort of his people. Amen.</p>

And while ſhe refuſed ſo to do, it was ſignified unto her, that ſhe could not be admitted for a member of the Church with us. After this alſo falling into ſpeech of mariage with one of the ſeparation, ſhe then began to leave our aſſemblie and went unto the meeting of the Browniſtes, pretending ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience about our uſe of the Lords prayer, as alſo about the truth of our Church &amp; miniſtery: and requeſted me both by her ſelf &amp; others to deale with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                        <hi>with you: ſo you have no reaſon to require this of me. We hold it good and holy, to uſe a right any of the Lords prayers, or any words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or thoſe or any of thoſe petitions taught us in Mat. 6. or Luke 11. in the words of eyther Evangelist, or other words, as the Spirit of God (which helpeth us to pray, Rom. 8.) leadeth us to any of them. If thus you doe, I blame you not. But if after prayer by the Spirit, you read that part of ſcripture for a prayer, or ſay it over by rote, as is the faſhion of many: that I approve not, it being neyther the intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, nor practiſe of his Apoſtles, that I can finde: &amp; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your proofs from Gods word for ſo uſing it. What our reaſons are againſt that abuſe, are to be ſeen in our</hi> Apologie
<hi>in Poſit. 9. thither I referr you. The chiefeſt thing that I miſlike in you about prayer, is: that wheras in December last, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H. your fellow miniſter taught you and your Church the trueth openly, and condemned praying on books, as is reported: you received not the trueth, but oppoſed it, and doe yet oppoſe it unto ſome among you, that are troubled therabout. It had been your own dutie to have taught the people how to ſerve God aright: but to reſiſt the trueth when God offreth it by your own bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is an heavy ſyn. The diſcuſsing herof, will fall out upon your anſwer given to the reaſons which before I referred you unto, in our Apologie, concerning prayer.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>About the lawfulnes of your miniſterie, that which I ſpake (as occaſion then called me) was by way of inquirie: aſking the man who is now declining unto you, whether you doe adminiſter here, by vertue of that calling which you had of the Biſhops of England or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it.

Secondly, the man ſuppoſing you had a new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination here by the Elderſhip of an other Church: we aſked him warrant for it from God, which he could not ſhew. If therfore it be ſo with you, I deſire your defenſe therof by the book of God: for I am yet ignorant, what authoritie the Elderſhip of one Church hath to</hi>

                        <hi>Other things there are, wherin you know we differ from you: as your keeping of holy dayes beſides the Lords dayes, and yet not half the holy dayes of the Church of England. Mariage a civil dutie, is performed by your miniſterie in your Church. Your Elderſhip ſitteth and judgeth matters apart from the congregation: and this your court I ſuppoſe wil finde no better allowance by the church or courts of England then doth our church, which you count ſchiſmatical. Of theſe things you may ſee your ſelves reproved and convicted in our</hi> Apologie <hi>aforeſayd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally, you ſhape your Church according to the time and place wherin you live. In England your people uſe the communion Book, keep ſuch holy dayes, have ſuch ceremonies, officers, courts, &amp;c. as the law there commandeth: here you are of an other ſeeming forme, and uſe not the things which your mother church requireth. Now I hold, that the conſtitution, worſhip, miniſterie, goverment, holy dayes of the Church ſhould be uniforme, and not variable in every coaſt. But to the things by you propounded, I have given anſwer, and directed you to our reaſons, which you may reply upon if you ſee cauſe. And if ſo you doe: as my leiſure ſerveth me, (who am for the preſent, imployed in other affaires, which I have undertaken with Gods help to performe with my moſt convenient ſpeed,) I wil through Chriſtes aſsiſtance mainteyn them againſt you. God guide you into the way of trueth and peace.</hi>

                        <p>In the meame time I do onely aſk this of you, whether you can with good conſcience admit them for members of your Church, who do profeſs they wil hold their liberty to heare thoſe whom they and you acknowledge to be in ſchiſme, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſeparate from the Church of Chriſt whereof they were members: for ſo do both aged M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. P. and I. Sh. judge of you. If you anſwer, no: Then how can you with any equity exclame againſt us for that thing wherein your ſelf agree with us: as though
<hi>ſuch meaſure</hi> was offred by us as is <hi>ſcarcely to be found at the hands of any Bp. miniſter or court in England,</hi> when as yet the ſame meaſure is to be expected at your owne hand? If you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yea: that you would admit ſuch: I doubt not but that your owne writings may juſtly be brought againſt you for your reproofe, &amp; conviction herein.</p>
                        <p>As for the commendation of your owne patience, as <hi>having learned to beare with comfort ſuch imputations of wrong</hi> as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of; me thinkes you make too much haſt vnto your owne praiſe: whether our patience in bearing with comfort your impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of falſe Church, miniſtery and vnlawfull commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22760:9"/>&amp;c. or your patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in bearing with comfort our complaints of wrong herein, be greater: let him that readeth judge upon the iſſue of your writing, when it appeares how that <hi>beſt good of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting our aberrations</hi> vnto us is performed by you.</p>
                        <p>For proofe that our Church continueth one with the church of England, you <hi>report your ſelf to the charitable libel which C. La, I.

As for the other penmen which in their writings here and there have ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at the ſame book: there is for them an anſwer in readines, to ſhew that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves are extreemely guilty of that which they vnjuſtly impute unto others: and that the writings for their ſeparation in reſpect of the manifold and horrible ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders conteyned therein, may indeed juſtly be noted, as moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Libels. 3.

                        <p>VVhereas you deny your offer of ſetting downe your reaſons either in word or writing, &amp;c: I have theſe reaſons out of your firſt writing to make me think otherwiſe. 1.

                        <p>You adde yet further; <hi>The cheefeſt thing that I miſlike about pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in you is: that whereas in December laſt, M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>.

The report you heard is vntrue in reſpect of the time of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hu. his preaching with vs; it was not in December laſt, but a whole twelve-moneth before. 2. VVhereas he ſpoke ſome things ambiguouſly in his Sermon touching ſet formes of prayer, being ſpoken vnto thereof by me before witneſſes, he explaned himſelf thus, that he did not condemne publique ſet formes of prayer, but thoſe onely that <pb n="15" facs="tcp:22760:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>did content themſelves therewith vſing no other prayer in private vnto God; he acknowledged that he had vſed the book of common prayer in England; and further that he had offred ſtil to read prayers out of the ſame book ſo that he might enjoy his liberty to preach: when he perceyved how ſome vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Sermon as hath bene reported to you he complayned that he vvas miſtaken. 3. For the vſe vvhich you draw from this falſe ground, I may juſtly apply it vnto your ſelf in your owne vvords: <hi>It had bene your owne duety to have taught the people</hi> the doctrine of religious communion both publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;

                           <hi>becauſe the reteyning thereof in ſuch vſe is a breach of the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Exod. 20.4.5.6. with Deut. 12.2.3.</hi> As for Eſay. 30.22. I ſuppoſe you alledge it for an other particular which is not our queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer: firſt, that commandement, Deut. 12. is as I take it a temporary ordinance, part of Moſes Politie that is now abrogate and therfore not perpetuall not binding vs in theſe times: For howſoever the equity thereof continue, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs to deteſt Idolatry, yet doth it not binde vs in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22760:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>and by ſuch meanes to ſignify our deteſtation thereof, as it did them in Moſes time? For example: as God here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands to aboliſh Idolatrous places, ſo in the next ch. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12.—15.16.17. God commands to aboliſh not onely their places of worſhip, but alſo all their goods, their cattel and all the ſpoyle of the Idolatrous apoſtates and to burne the ſame with fire. The equity of this commandement leads vs to a great deteſtation of Idolatry and apoſtaſy: but who will ſay that it is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the very ſame meanes and maner of judgement in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſuch things as are of neceſſary vſe? And yet according to your reaſoning from this place: the goods, cattell &amp; treaſures of ſilver and Gold, even of thouſand thouſands of peoples at this day ſhould be avoyded as execrable things, and neither by changing, buying, ſelling, borowing or any other dealing to be medled with all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, as God commands to deſtroy idolatrous places, ſo he commands to aboliſh their names, and not to reteyne them
<hi>Deut.</hi> 12.3. This commandement appeares hereby to be temporary and ceremoniall, becauſe now in the new Teſtament, we ſee that the names of divers Idolles have bene reteyned in the perſons therevpon denominate: as the name of <hi>Mercurie, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Phebe, Iupiter, Apollo, Fortuna,</hi> that were heathniſh Idolles worſhipped for Gods and Goddeſſes and yet their names not aboliſhed in the Saints mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.14.

                        <p>Fourthly, ſeing meats ſacrificed to Idolles were as much pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22760:15"/>as the places of their vvorſhip, &amp; yet notwithſtanding may now lawfully be reteyned for our neceſſary vſe,

                        <p>Fiftly, as God commands to aboliſh the high places of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, ſo he doth as well command to aboliſh and conſume his owne holy things, when the Religious vſe of them ceaſed; for example he commands to burne the remainder of the Paſchal Lamb which they could not eat the ſame night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.10. as alſo the fleſh of the Ramme of conſecration with the bread thereof that remayned to the morning,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 29.34. And the like commandement was given for the fleſh of the peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7,15.19. The equity of theſe ordinances conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth for ever, teaching vs how to regard the holy things of God, not according to the common vſe of other things, but with a more high and pretious eſtimation of them: but we may not according to the letter of the ceremony and according to your reaſoning aboliſh them: for then the bread &amp; wine that remaines over after the adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper ſhould ſtill be burnt, or otherwiſe aboliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, there is not the like reaſon to aboliſh the buildings abuſed vnto Idolatry now, as the high places of old, becauſe God having then appoynted one onely place for ſacrifice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5.6, &amp;c. <hi>Levit. 17.3.4.</hi> Thoſe high places being for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice were to be deſtroyed, though no Idolatry had bene committed in them: but being polluted with the ſervice of Idolles, there was then double cauſe of their deſtruction, which is not now in theſe, while difference of place is taken away <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 21</p>
                        <p>Thus you may ſee though. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.2.3. be compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4.5.6. Yet is there no ſtrength therein for the purpoſe intended.</p>

                        <p>After theſe 4. particulars, you ſay, <hi>Other things there are where in we know you differ from vs: as our keeping of holy dayes beſides the Lords dayes, &amp;c. Mariage a civil duety performed by our miniſtery in our Church: Our Elderſhip ſitting and iudging matters apart from the congregations, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, the queſtion betwixt vs, is not about all things wherein you differ from vs, but onely about thoſe differences which you hold to be juſt cauſes of renouncing our communion. Other great or greater differences then theſe, there are alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs: as that you allow not your people to mary with the members of the reformed Churches as we do, but make ſuch Mariages to be a cauſe of excommunicating your people, as though the godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of theſe true Churches were like the abhominable Canaanites in your ſight: That you allow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages made among your ſelves without conſent and authority of the Magiſtrates: and this both in England and here alſo, where the lawes do hold the Children of ſuch as are ſo maryed to be illegitimate: That you alſo allow divorces among your ſelves without the authority of the Magiſtrate: That you turne the Lords day into a ſeſsion or Court-day, omitting and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out in part ſometimes the adminiſtration of the word &amp; Sacraments, by ſpending ſo much time in controverſies &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: That you condemne the ſet maintenance of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; with ſundry other differences, which I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you maintaine as cauſes of ſeparation from vs. Theſe are yet in Compariſon your ſingle errours, vvhereas your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſchiſme is a double iniquity and an errour of errours: If in defence hereof you can prove our Church and miniſtery to be falſe, as hath bene oft avouched by you: you may then lay the axe of your ſeparation vnto the root of our Religion and hew vs downe at once: If you can ſhew our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or place of worſhip to be vnlawfull, it would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22760:21"/>to the purpoſe: If you alledge other differences, and do not prove them to be cauſes of ſeparation, you wander from the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we knovv alſo that there are differences among your ſelves, both about ſome of theſe ſame, and other greater matters: and not onely betwixt you and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> but in your owne congregation alſo: as that ſome of your people vpon the holy dayes by you mentioned, ſhut vp their ſhops: others not, as is
<note n="*" place="margin">Inquiry. p. 59. 60.</note> acknowledged by your ſelves vnto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>White:</hi> That ſome of you hold an enforced divorce, and that the
<note n="a" place="margin">Ibid. p. 32 33.</note> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties innocent either huſband or wife which forgive one an other being guilty of adultery and live ſtill togather are to be excommunicated; others holding the contrary: That ſome of your people are of your minde in denying private commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the godly in England and yet ſome even of your owne congregation do allow ſuch communion, holding rather with Mr.
<hi>Robinſon</hi> then with you, that refuſe to anſwer him: So that if notwithſtanding theſe and the like differences, you can yet hold communion among your ſelves, and with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> it may ſeeme that theſe three laſt differences above noted by you, are not intended as cauſes of ſeparation, and ſo belong not to our queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, our differing in thoſe 3 poynts nominated by you, is duely to be weighed of you: 1, <hi>for keeping of holy dayes:</hi> vve hold all dayes (except the Lords day) to be alike holy: If our people at the Magiſtrates appoyntment do ſhut vp their ſhops without putting holynes in the day, it is confeſſed that your people do the ſame alſo: That ordinary day of the week which we have for a ſermon is ſometimes changed vnto one of thoſe holy dayes (as they are called) and we preach on the ſame, to redeeme time for mens labour, and to win opportunity to preach the word vnto many in ſeaſon or out of ſeaſon; and this alſo, as I heare is done by you, and that by a memorable token at one time eſpecially; the time of your rending from Mr. Iohnſon being on a Chriſtmas day ſo called, vnto which day<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22760:22"/>you had changed the ordinary time of your aſſembling in the week. Thus far you agree with vs: &amp; this being granted lawfull, the reſt if it be any thing will follow. 2. <hi>For Mariages:</hi> we do not hold it as a thing of neceſsity, that they ſhould be celebrated by miniſters in the Church; we judge them lawfull mariages that are made by the Magiſtrates without miniſters: but yet vve hold it lawfull, more convenient, and comfortable that they be accompliſhed in the Church by the Miniſters, both for ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the dueties of the perſons maryed and for obteyning a ſpeciall bleſſing by the prayers of the congregation. 3. For <hi>our Elderſhip ſitting and judging matters, &amp;c.</hi> though our Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the examination of parties and witneſſes, and for their conſultations thereabout do ſit a part, as is meet; yet do we not exclude or debar any from hearing and ſeeing the conviction of any ſin that is either publique of it ſelf or perſiſted in, when they deſire the ſame; yea we our ſelves have oft deſired their preſence to behold the convictions, admonitions and rebukes of offenders: and further, before any ſentence be given for the cutting off of any offendour, we do firſt propound the matter vnto the whole Church, requiring their prayers, adviſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without which never yet any judgement of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath bene executed againſt any amongſt vs: And this alſo is propounded vnto them by divers degrees, long and oft before any pronouncing of ſentence, that ſo our brethren may have ſufficient time, both to informe themſelves of the matter and to deliberate ripely thereof. And even this ſitting of our Elderſhip a part from the congregation, ſeemes to have bene allowed by your ſelf, for as much as in a matter of controverſy, you and your Elder M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Th.</hi> have not refuſed to come &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before this our Elderſhip, and there to give what light &amp; evidence you could vnto the matter in queſtion; and thus alſo have others of your people at other times voluntarily come and appeared as witneſſes before vs: and have ſo far communicated with our governement.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>you ſuppoſe that this our court ſhall finde no better allowance</hi>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:22760:22"/>
                           <hi>by the Church or Courts of England then doth your Church which we counte ſchiſmaticall.</hi> A vaine ſuppoſition: for 1. though our elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould finde no favour nor allowance from the prelats or courts of England, yet have we comfort in Gods allowance: we depend on Chriſt and not vpon prelates. 2. The allowance of the reformed Churches which give vs the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being layd in ballance with the diſallowance of prelates is enough to countervaile the ſame: A comfort that you are far from. 3. Even the cheef defendours of the prelacy can not but give allowance vnto our elderſhip, confeſſing that this gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement

                           <hi>may be admitted, and that it is as ſilver, good;</hi> though they prefer their owne as Gold before the ſame.</p>
                        <p>You adde further, that <hi>of theſe things we may ſee our ſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and convicted in your Apology aforeſayd.</hi> But this is alſo a vaine ſpeech: firſt, there is no ſuch conviction to be ſeene in your Apology; but this we rather ſee, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of your Apology is in his conſcience reproved &amp; convicted of divers of theſe errours that he hath written: we ſee ſome of his people coming vnto our Sermons, even on thoſe holy dayes you ſpeak of: we ſee others of them willing and deſirous to have their mariages celebrated in our congregation, even whiles they remaine with him ſtill: we ſee his governement changed, but who knowes what it now is? we ſee him broken &amp; confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his courſes but without ſuch true repentance, as ſhould bring him plainely to confeſſe, to revoke &amp; to refute his errours wherewith he hath bene a meanes to enſnare ſo many. And the ſight of this confuſion in him might be ſufficient to ſerve for your iuſt reproofe alſo, if you conſider it a right.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe you had ſufficiently convicted vs by your Apology in thoſe differences betwixt vs, yet is not your refuſall of our communion for the ſame iuſtifyed thereby; that is the queſtion that remaines vnproved. VVhen I receyve any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from you to that purpoſe, I will then godwilling give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer both to thoſe arguments for ſeparation from vs, as alſo to ſo many reaſons as I can finde in your Apology touching thoſe<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22760:23"/>three particulars them ſelves.</p>
                        <p>In fine, you tel vs, that <hi>we ſhape our Church according to the time and place wherein we live, &amp;c.</hi> Touching this imputation of variablenes, I anſwer for my ſelf, that when I lived in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, I teſtifyed againſt the evilles which I conceyved to be in the order of that Chureh: and when I was called hither I reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to finde thoſe things that I had deſired before and this with out variablenes. And the communion which we ſtill vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hold with the Church of England, can no more deſtroy the truth of our Church, then it doth other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which practiſe in like maner. But if you come to ſpeake of variablenes, and ſhaping a mans ſelf to the time and place, you give vs occaſion to remember your owne levity &amp; ſcandall in this behalfe: But I ſpare you for this time.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, ſeing that beſides the common and generall motives which may binde vs to deale faithfully and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in all our wayes, we have at this preſent alſo the hand of God lying vpon the City where we live, and his deſtroying angell is come into our ſtreets: ſo that many fall both on the right hand and on the left, through the noyſome peſtilence that walketh in the dark and waſteth at noone day: let vs therfore ſo write as if the arrowes of th'almighty did ſtick faſt in vs: Let vs with all our might ſeek thoſe things that may ſerve for the aedification of the Church of God, with his praiſe and our peace therein: even ſo as if ech of our writings were to be ſealed with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſſolution. He vvhoſe name is counſellour &amp; the mighty God guide vs herevnto: Farewell in the Lord.</p>

One meanes to further this, I take to be the abridging and if it may be, the quite cutting off of all leſse needfull matters, and holding to the mayn differences: an other, that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe things by the word of God, not of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So firſt to end the ſtrife about the provocation to this controverſie: for as much as ſundry works are publiſhed on your ſide and ours, I held them ſufficient to ſhew vnto judicious Readers, that would examine the ſcriptures and reaſons brought on eyther part, where the trueth lyeth, and purpoſed therfore to write no more this way, vnleſſe further and more probable obiections were publickly brought againſt vs. And I turned the courſe of my ſtudies an other way, as is openly to be ſeen. Neyther would I take occaſion to meddle, though provoked by you and yours, more then by any other: as I ſhewed you in part, by inſtances of ſome that could not be admitted to the Lords ſupper with you, for that they heard the doctrine of our Church, or thought it lawfull onely (as was ſayd,) though they never did it. This I yet think to be more ſeverity on your part againſt vs, then any Biſhop in England would ſhew: how juſtly you may doe it, remaineth to be judged, when the differences between vs are diſcuſſed. And as for the provocation of our people, wheron you inſiſt: I know it not: the man whom you named, denyed it to me before witneſſes, and ſayd: ſome of yours were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of it, as he could prove. But now that you have taken ſuch an occaſion, and we are entred into theſe lists, let vs proceed.</hi>

                     <hi>For the order of our proceſſe, wheras you beginning with me, would yet vrge me to ſet down my reaſons, when as you ſaw them in print: I leav it vnto judgment, how meet this was. As you knew that the chief Author of our Apologie, had revoked ſome doctrines and reaſons therin: ſo you might have knowen that I and others, intereſſed in that</hi>

My large offer to yeild to any kinde of conference with you, at your requeſt; was not intended, neyther ſhould be ſtreyned to any other then an orderly courſe. Yet I ſet you downe a mayn ground, as you deſired, and that I am content to follow.</hi>

                  <p>

                        <hi>that thoſe reaſons are directed against the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and the miniſterie therof: the reaſons that you deſired of me, were ſuch as I had for our ſeparation from your particular Church, and the miniſterie therof.</hi>

                     <hi>To which I anſwer: In that they are directed againſt the Church of England they are alſo againſt yours: for you were members of that Church, and guiltie of the ſynns reproved in my argument, as we our ſelves alſo were, whiles we continued among them. Now the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your dwelling into an other land, removeth not your ſynns from you, nor you from them: it is your repentance onely, and faith in Chriſt, that can purge away your ſynns, Luke 13.3.5. Mar. 1.15. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that dwell here, in England or other where, belong to the Church of Rome, til they break off themſelves by repentance. Neyther doth the abſteyning from the practiſe clear the ſynner: for the guilt of Cains murder, cleaved vnto him all his dayes, becauſe he was not cleanſed by repentance and faith; although he never killed man more, after Abel. So though you here practiſe not the idolatries doen in England yet in that you have practiſed them, and not repented, your guiltines is vpon you. How much more then doe your ſynns remaine, which oppoſe and ſpeak evill of vs, privately, publickly and in print, for departing from the evils, wherein we ſometimes walked among them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I manifested your vnion with the Church of England by the very title of that book publiſhed by your own proſelytes, which ſayth,</hi>

                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                        <hi>We did openly renounce our covenant and profeſsion of ſeparation, which at our firſt entrance among them, we had made with them: we renounced it as being a most abominable and profane thing. Will you ſay that all theſe words were alſo foiſted in by ſome falſifier?</hi>

Ainſworth, Had you obſerved your owne directions for performing the counſell which you ſo well liked of, then would you not have brought in ſuch ſtore of humane teſtimonies, and thoſe of the worſt ſort, and them alſo in the worſt maner, as you have done: then would you not have inſerted ſo many leſſe needfull matters, but have kept more cloſely vnto the maine differences. VVhen you ſpeak of of <hi>ending the ſtrife about the provocation to this controverſie,</hi> you begin it a freſh by bringing ſuch a reaſon of your ſilence, as ſerves for a ſtrong provocation to deale againſt you: the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of it is: there was ſo much written on both ſides, as you <hi>held ſufficient to ſhew vnto judicious Readers where the truth lay, &amp; therfore purpoſed to write no more this way, vnleſſe more probable obiections were brought againſt you:</hi> as if you ſhould have ſayd in triumph: All is wonne: Separation hath gotten the victory: all of judgement may ſee it: there is nothing of weight or worth, nothing ſo probably written againſt vs, that deſerves any more anſwer, therfore I will reſt. VVho is it that ſees the ſeparation clapping her wings &amp; crowing on this maner, boaſting againſt all the Churches of Chriſt, and againſt all the godly &amp; learned Miniſters and members of the ſame, but they may juſtly be mooved by ſuch a provocation as this? VVhereas you tell vs of <hi>turning the courſe of your ſtudies an other way:</hi> &amp; that it may <hi>openly be ſeen:</hi> vve ſee indeed that you are about a new tranſlation of the Bible with annotations vpon the ſame, but it vvere much better for you to turne back the courſe of your ſtudies, to ſtay this work a while, and in the feare of God firſt to examine your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22760:25"/>ſeparation more ſoundly then you have done, and ſo to free &amp; cleare yourſelf of that errour and ſcandall which you have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the hurt and greefe of many a ſoule. Vnleſſe you take this courſe, one of theſe two things will follow: Either you muſt make an vncleane work, or have an vncleane conſcience: for if in your annotations you expound the ſcriptures all along as you go, according to that vvhich you have done in your other former writings for the maintenance of ſeparation, then ſhall you give many vncleane notes, and defile the holy ſcriptures &amp; lead vnto ſchiſme: if in all your annotations for winning credit vnto them you do conceale your meaning, and hide your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion notwithſtanding all opportunities given, what do you els but betray the ſuppoſed truth, when as in your account it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and vnjuſtly oppugned, and pollute your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with this vnfaithfull dealing?</p>
                  <p>As for your provocation by vs, in that we admit not ſuch for members of our Church as would have liberty to heare your Sermons, I gave you anſwer in my former writing, which here you take no knowledge of. This is no good way, <hi>to abridge</hi> leſs needfull matters, by repeating and renewing vnjuſt complaints of hard dealing and omitting the anſwers given already there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. You refer the matter vnto judgement of the Readers, and ten times you appeale vnto them in this writing: I agree with you herein, onely I entreat the Readers to ſee what is vvritten before, and ſtill to compare our vvritings diligently togather that they may ſee what is anſwered, and vvhat is omitted &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by: And therfore alſo have I cauſed theſe writings to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that the reader might have them to judge by. As for the man by whom I vvas provoked; If he deny it novv, yet that impeacheth not the truth of my aſſertion, vvhiles I have ſundry vvitneſſes to confirme the ſame. And it ſkilles not ſo much, vvhat he novv ſaith of himſelf before vvitnes, as vvhat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vvitneſſes do teſtify of him and his ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>That I had cauſe enough to deſire you to ſet downe your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſeparating fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs notvvithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thoſe reaſons already<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22760:26"/>printed in your Apologie, is plaine: for firſt, though I knew you and ſome of your people had not yet openly revoked them, yet ſeing M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Iohnſon the cheefe Author thereof had begun to recall them and refute them alſo himſelf, it was no blame worthy matter in me herevpon to give you occaſion to think more ſeriouſly of them, and to give you liberty of ſetting them downe more adviſedly. My ſecond reaſon noted alſo in my former writing, you touch not at all. You ſpeak of ſtreyning your offer beyond an orderly courſe, but you cannot affirme, much leſſe prove that I have done ſo by you. Vnto my third defence of requiring your reaſons for your ſeparation from our particular Church and Miniſtery, becauſe thoſe in your Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are directed againſt the Church of England and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof &amp; not againſt vs: you reply that becauſe we have not repented for being members of the Church of England, therfore our ſins remaine, and therfore the reaſons directed againſt the Church of England, are againſt ours alſo. This want of repentance you do alſo alledge ſundry times againe in the heart of your treatiſe, as your maine ground to prove the vnlawfullnes both of our Church &amp; miniſtery &amp; to maintaine your ſeparation from the ſame: And there may you finde a full and large anſwer herevnto, chap. 4. and 6. to ſhew that you have cauſe to repent your ſelf for ſuch maner of reaſoning againſt the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>VVhen as to make way for the turning of your argument from vs to the Church of England, you alledged the title of a book publiſhed againſt your ſchiſme and the proſelytes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſhewed you that your allegation was a forgery, your excuſe now is that <hi>you knew not of it:</hi> But I prevented this excuſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my former writing and ſhewed you the inſufficiency thereof, ſeing the matter was publiſhed vnto you that you might have knowne it, ſee before p. 8. &amp; 9. Againe, you do here cite many places of that
<note n="a" place="margin">Profane ſchiſme of Brow.</note> booke, to ſhew that the publiſhers thereof did renounce their ſeparation from the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, &amp;c. But what an idle and loſt labour is this to keep ſuch<pb n="41" facs="tcp:22760:26"/>a doe for proofe of that which we all do ſo freely and dayly confeſs and profeſſe before all, &amp; I did alſo acknowledge in my former writing? Is this dealing agreeable to your pretence of abridging or quite cutting off all leſs needfull matters? what is leſs needfull then to be ſo large in proof of that which is not denyed? Nay yourſelf do here acknowledge for vs that we do not diſclayme an vnion with the Church of England. Yet are you not content with this, but in the margent of your writing you pray me to tell you in the name of our Church <hi>whether we deny that we continue in the boſome of the Church of England.</hi> Though I told you plainely enough before in my
<note n="b" place="margin">See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pag. 9.</note> former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if you had had eares to heare, yet to ſatisfy your needleſs importunitie, I anſwer you againe in the behalf of our church, that if you meane by living in the boſome of the Church to live vnder the eccleſiaſtical cenſure and governement of the Church, then do we not live in the boſome of the Church of England; but are here in theſe low countries a diſtinct body and Church from them: if you meane a reteyning of Chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, in this ſenſe we do remaine in the boſome of that Church of Chriſt, practiſing communion vpon all good occaſion, and hold them guilty of ſchiſme that refuſe to do the like. But then you demand further herevpon, <hi>why do I now ſeek to turne away the diſcuſsing of the reaſons of your ſeparation from the Church of England? who would not now expect at my hands a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church of England?</hi> I anſwer, 1. There is no reaſon to expect at my hands in this preſent controverſie, a diſcuſſing of all that I hold &amp; practiſe; ſo might I enter into an hundred controverſies at once, touching all the artickles of my faith and profeſſion. 2. For the defence of the Church of England, there are many learned men that have already written ſundry treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and juſtifyed the lawfullnes of the communion therein againſt you, whereas there is none that hath written any book in defence of this particular Church whereof I am a miniſter: neither is any man ſo much bound herevnto as I am. 3. Even this queſtion which I vndertake againſt you is not a turning<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22760:27"/>away, but a leading of you by degrees vnto communion with the Church of England: you know the plaineſt method of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is to proceed <hi>a notioribus ad minus nota,</hi> &amp; I doubt not but you being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced of your etrour in ſeparating from this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will thereby be prepared and holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the errour of ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Church of England alſo.</p>
                  <p>Here you inſert yet a new reaſon why I ſhould rather diſcuſs the reaſons of your ſeparation from England namely,
<hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what profeſsion you make in the preface to the confeſsion of your faith (printed with your Apologie) of your agreeing with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reformed Churches round about vs (ſome of which you there name) and of your ſeparation onely from the Antichriſtian Church of England, &amp;c.</hi> But, oh M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth, what truth is there in theſe wordes? This your profeſſion here mentioned by you is a counterfaite profeſſion and moſt vntrue; If you ſeparate <hi>onely</hi> from the Antichriſtian Church of England, why do you even in this very writing maintaine the ſeparation of your Elder <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe</hi> from the French Church? why are not ſuch of your people as vnderſtand their language allowed to heare in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? Yea why do you publiſh in print concerning the Dutch and French Churches in theſe countries, that for the members of your Church they cannot partake with rhem, no not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word <hi>without declining and apoſtaſy from the truth which you have receyved.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inquiry of Th. wh. Pag. 26.</note> In the beginning of your writing you prefix the ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>Love the truth and peace:</hi> but by this dealing you ſeeme to love falſhood &amp; diſſembling more then truth; And now for this deceitfull dealing there is ſo much the more reaſon to lay out your ſeparation from other Churches as well as from England, that ſimple men may no more be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled by you.</p>
                  <p>One other needfull and weighty matter you will yet have to be conſidered, before you come to your argument, namely, that <hi>you rather might have deſired the reaſons of our ſeparation from your particular church, for beſides that ſome of our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers were firſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of you, your Church is before ours, &amp;c. &amp; we coming after, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>

The reaſon why we conſulted not with you at our firſt comming vnto this citie, was becauſe you had already before my coming declared your ſelves to be open ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the truth by diſclayming and renouncing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all the Churches of Chriſt, to the great offence of the godly in our own countrie, as alſo of the godly Magiſtrates Miniſters and people in this citie, I ſaw by your writings what evill counſailours you were, and what perverſe reaſonings you vſed therein and how you contemned the adviſe of ſuch as had dealt with you and therfore thought it not meete to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate our proceedings with you. 2. Our purpoſe &amp; proceedings were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with many learned miniſters Engliſh, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, Dutch &amp; Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch who gave vs counſaile &amp; help in our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſo that we needed not to communicate our affaires with you. The hand of God was with vs: the Reformed churches gave vs the right hand of fellowſhip: the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates was with vs through the mercy of God that gave vs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in their eyes &amp; put it into their hearts to further our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, ſo that at my comming hither, there was then firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this citie a lawfull congregation of the Engliſh, and then divers which had before left your Church &amp; gone vnto the Dutch did from thence come &amp; joyne themſelves to vs: &amp; ſince that time many other of your people leaving your ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me have come vnto vs, the Lord ſtill encreaſing his bleſſing vpon our labours. 3. Suppoſe here had bene in this city a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Engliſh church before our comming hither, &amp; that we had offended in not communicating our proceedings with the ſame, yet had not this fault bene like vnto your ſeparation; it is one thing to neglect the counſell of ſome godly men, an other to renounce communion of all true Churches.

                     <hi>of the Godly in England. To convince vs of ſyn herein, you bring no one word of God, but would preſse vs with the writings of men.

You inſult therfore in vaine, as if this (if it were granted) vvould raſe the principles of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and as if I therfore refuſed to deale therwith.

                     <hi>Now though I need ſay no more of this matter, ſeing you have ſayd nothing from the ſcriptures againſt vs: yet I wil ſhew you what I judge of this doctrine. All private communion with the godly in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland I deny not: ſuch as are come to that meaſure of grace, as that they are worthy in Chriſt, to be received into the true viſible Church, in that eſtate: with them I hold it lawful to have private communion, even before they be joyned to the Church. But ſuch as for their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian eſtate and walking, are by the rules of Gods word, debarred from admiſsion into the Church of Chriſt til they repent &amp; leave their ſyn: with them I hold it not lawfull to have private communion, though ſome good things appeare to be in them, which I wil labour to cheriſh. And this is that which I intend in my anſwer to M. Bernard, in that place of my Book which you cite, and I never held otherwiſe. If you can prove ſyn in this doctrine, I wil hear you, ſpeaking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God: other authoritie I refuſe to be preſſed with. And when you have proved vs to ſyn herein, (if ever you be able:) then are you to begin a new with your Church eſtate, which will not at all be juſtified hereby.</hi>

I ſhewed the weaknes of your profe of it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enumeratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe things that you profeſſed to ſeparate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: My firſt exception was, that as you ſeparated from the Dutch &amp; French Churches ſo from ours alſo: me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioning your ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Dutch &amp; French onely to illuſtrate your fact &amp; your dealing with ours: This exception you devide into two, &amp; reply many things with litle reaſon: And <hi>firſt, you pray me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how ſoundly &amp; directly I anſwer vnto thoſe 4. heads of tranſgreſsion, which you named: when I neither ingenuouſly grant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me to convince them, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, my anſwer vnto your argument is ſound and direct though I meddle not with thoſe 4. tranſgreſſions at all: It is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:22760:30"/>enough to ſhew the falſhood of any argument, if we ſhew any part of the firſt or ſecond propoſition to be falſe: and it is in the anſwerers choyſe to deny what he will: But you, as if you regarded not the lawes of learning and the rules of right reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, do grudge this liberty vnto me and expoſtulate with me as if the opponent might preſcribe the anſwerer what to grant and what to deny. Doth not your argument of <hi>ſeparating from ſin onely</hi> fall manifeſtly vnto the ground, and the honour of it ly in the duſt, when I give you ſome inſtances wherein you cannot prove that you ſeparate from ſin onely? why do you then trifle about ſurmiſes of I know not what inconveniences? Oh, but you complaine, <hi>that I will walk at liberty and you muſt be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in cords: you muſt prove directly, &amp; I may anſwer indirectly.</hi> But you are herein a very vnjuſt murmurer: &amp; you are herein like vnto a Nigardly perſon who deſiring to ſeeme liberall makes proffer of ſome kindenes, where he thinkes it wil not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: but ſeeing it accepted contrary to his expectation, then he repents and frets in himſelf and grumbles againſt the perſon that hath accepted his offer: did not you offer me to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with me <hi>of</hi>

                     <hi>what poynt or poynts I would?</hi> vvhy do you now grudge to performe it? have not you framed and faſhioned your argument your ſelf? why do you with ſuch an ill-wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequute it in order? If it be a paine vnto you that you are bound: it is but in the cords of your owne offer and of your owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: you muſt blame your ſelf for it. If I walk at liberty it is but in the plaine pathway of direct reaſoning: let men of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning judge. And why do you trifle about the expectation of it may be two or three of our people (which yet I know not of) that ſuppoſed the queſtion betwixt vs was otherwiſe then it is; as if I ſhould alter the ſtate of the queſtion layd downe betwixt vs, vpon ſuch a pretence? How vnjuſtly do you complaine that I <hi>with draw at the firſt?</hi> I withdraw not one inch from the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion layd downe plainely of purpoſe by my ſelf to avoyd ſuch cavils as theſe: But loe, it is you which ſpeaking of our

                     <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into liſts,</hi> which were deſcribed by me &amp; approved by your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:22760:31"/>ſelf do yet at the very firſt encounter ſtart aſide from theſe liſts or bounds into an other field, and at one ſkip leap out of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many into England.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to ſalve or to mitigate a litle the paine of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, if it may be, I doe plainely ſignify vnto you that my reſolution and purpoſe is (the Lord aſſiſting me with life &amp; ſtrength) to deale with you about your ſeparation from the Church of England, and to manifeſt your errour and ſchiſme therein alſo, vvhen once this controverſy about our particular congregation ſhalbe finiſhed and ſufficiently diſcuſſed. In the meane time I think to hold vnto this, being ſo fit a preparation vnto the other.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you reply further, that <hi>to enſnare your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſin, I bring no one word of the Law of God, whereby ſin is to be knowne, but alledge the congregations of men. That this may be a ſtumbling block to the weak, &amp;c. a common practiſe of the Papiſts to dazel mens eyes, &amp;c. To the law and to the teſtimony, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a great wrong and an vrter perverting of my anſwer to ſay I alledge the congregations of men to enſnare you in ſin, as though I drew an argument from the authority of men to convince your errour. I make no argument there at all, but give anſwer vnto you, and there againe onely in a matter of fact I declare the maner of your ſeparation to be otherwiſe then you pretended in ſpeaking of your ſeparation from thoſe
4. heads of tranſgreſſion: there I ſhew that your ſeparation is not onely from thoſe 4. things, but alſo that as you ſeparate from the Dutch and French, ſo do you from ours, thereby to give you occaſion to make good your argument for the reiecting of our congregation, and ſo to come vnto the particulars concerning the ſame, in defence whereof I hope to manifeſt how much you have abuſed the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the blame vvhich you impute vnto me for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of humane teſtimonies to dazel the eyes of men, &amp;c. is juſtly to be returned vpon your owne head, who do ſo often cite them and call for them to be your witneſſes, even all ſorts<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22760:31"/>of them, heathniſh, Popiſh, Iewiſh Authors, yea the very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themſelves and the Spirits of divination. For example</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the allegations of heathens, ſee how needleſly you alledge them; when you ſhew vnto M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. <hi>Iohnſon</hi> the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the common wealth and miniſters in the church, you content not yourſelf with the ſcriptures, but you
<note n="c" place="margin">Animad. verſ. p. 15.</note> call for the teſtimony of <hi>Cato</hi> to reprove him. VVhen you tell him of aequivocating, and ſhew it to be a common practiſe of ſuch as would deceive, you
<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 35.</note> call for the vvitneſſe of Ariſtotle againſt him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For allegation of Popiſh witneſſes, you produce many of them in this writing, as Pope <hi>Sylveſter, Helmoldus, Geroldus &amp; Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wannus,</hi> &amp; other fabulous writers to reprove our opinion and practiſe; you that ſo litle regard

                  <p n="3">3. For Iewiſh writers, you produce them ſo often, both

Iohnſon and alſo in this your writing, that all men may ſee, you do not onely go <hi>to the law and to the teſtimony,</hi> but to the Talmud &amp; to the Rabbines, to the Infidel Iewes: though the

                     <hi>it may alſo be obſerved, how in this word ISRAEL are conteyned the firſt letters of the names of</hi> Abraham <hi>and of</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife; of</hi> Iſaak <hi>and</hi> Rebekah <hi>his wife: of</hi> Iaakob <hi>and of both his Wives</hi> Leah <hi>and</hi> Rachel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this were a lawfull or tolerable obſervation, you might as well for the counte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ancing of your ſchiſme, make the like obſervation vpon the name of

                  <p n="4">4. For your allegation of the teſtimony of witches or Spirits of divination, your fault herein alſo appeares to be very great. 1. In that you

95.</note> alledge the Oracles of the <hi>Sibylles,</hi> women poſſeſſed and inſpired by the Devil: herein you offend againſt your owne
<note n="r" place="margin">Eſa. 8.20</note> allegation, <hi>to the law and to the teſtimony;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ibid. 19.</note> verſe going before in the ſame chapter: <hi>Should not a people enquire at their God, ſhould they go from the living to the dead?</hi> A man might as well and as lawfully
<note n="t" place="margin">2 Kin. 1.2.3 4-16</note> with Ahaziah that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked King of Iſrael have ſent to enquire at the Oracle of

<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 16.17.18.</note> greeved at the teſtimony of the mayd that had the Spirit of divination: but you on the contrary require the<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22760:32"/>Spirit of divination to ſpeak vnto vs, and call vnto <hi>Sibyll</hi> that ſhe may cry after vs with her teſtimony. 2. This allegation is ſo much the more vile, then the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of many other witches that wicked men ſeek vnto, in reſpect of the moſt filthy and abhominable maner whereby this wretched wight did both receive and vtter againe the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vncleane Spirit, namely not by her mouth onely, but her belly being ſwollen, and ſhe ſitting vpon the ſacred ſtoole or Tripos, then came the ſtinking Oracle from vnder or out of the ſtoole below. This kinde of impure divination is noted both in the
<note n="y" place="margin">Ob, &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. Lev. 19.31 &amp;

18.11.</note> titles which other writers give them to ſignify their ſpeaking out of their bellies: And this monſtrous impurity is more largely deſcribed by ſundry other witneſſes and by ſome that are printed togather with that booke, from whence you alledge thoſe oracles of
<hi>Sibylla.</hi> VVherfore then ſhould ſuch vncleane ſtuffe be brought vnto Chriſtian eares: and why do you <hi>Mr. Ainſworth</hi> adorne your writings with ſuch excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vncleane and wicked Spirits? 3. It is ſin to go vnto vvitches for any Silver or cattel or ſuch like earthly goods when they are loſt or ſtollen, but to go vnto a Spirit of divination to enquire for the truth of Religion when it is hidden, loſt or obſcured by the adverſaries thereof, who do by their controverſies as it were ſteale the ſame: this is yet a greater iniquitie, this is to make the father of lyes a guide vnto the truth, and to ſet Satan in Gods ſeate. 4. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their neceſſities, dangers and temptations go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vviſardes: for as you tell
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon</hi> when he alledgeth the opinion of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iunius</hi> for his cauſe:
<note n="a" place="margin">Animad. verſ. p. 98.</note> 
                     <hi>What will not men do for help in time of need?</hi> Yet are not ſuch excuſed thereby: for God is

<hi>Sibylla?</hi> what needed<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22760:33"/>you to run to the Spirit of divination to prove
<note n="c" place="margin">Animad. verſ. p. 95.</note> Antichriſte to be Belial, as though the ſcriptures did not ſhew it ſufficiently? How frivolous and idle à flouriſh do you make with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Sibylla</hi> in the
<note n="d" place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poy. p. 47.</note> other place to give ſome colour vnto ſuch an expoſition of ſcripture, as even your ſelf in the next page do reiect as vncertaine if not falſe? How juſt is the
<note n="e" place="margin">Refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Giff. pag. 120.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of <hi>H. Barow</hi> vpon you, when he inveigheth againſt thoſe that <hi>fetch the ornaments of their ſtile and of their bookes from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Writers</hi> though it were but to <hi>exemplify and illustrate</hi> that which the ſayd? what would he have ſayd think you, if he had ſeene you paint and varniſh the margent of your bookes vvith ſuch allegations as theſe?
5. Thoſe vvritings, from whence you alledge the teſtimonies of
<hi>Sibylla</hi> are even by the publiſher of that book himſelf in his preface manifeſted to be forged and counterfait things for the moſt part: Now it is ſin to ly of the Divel, why do you then alledge in the name of
<hi>Sibylla,</hi> you know not what? How greedy are you of vaine allegations, that thus lick vp the crummes and fragments of <hi>Sibyll,</hi> &amp; graſp after the ſhadow of a ſorcereſſe? Though ſome ancient writers have heretofore vſed the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Sibyls, againſt the pagans that worſhipped the divel, to convince them by their owne oracles, which then were not ſo counterfait and forged as now they are, yet have not you the like excuſe, that want the like occaſion for the vſe of them. Theſe things I have thought good to note the more largely (though many other evils might further be obſerved in theſe your allegations) becauſe your maner ſtill is through out your writings to vpbrayd vs ſo much with that which your ſelf are more guilty of.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, you reply that we <hi>have no more reaſon (if ſo much to ſay that you have ſeparated from the Dutch Churches, then that they have ſeparated from you, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This doth not diminiſh the truth of my former anſwer; if you have ſeparated from the Dutch, then have you not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated onely from thoſe 4. heads, mentioned in your argument.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:22760:33"/>2. Neither doth this diminiſh your ſin, but encreaſe the ſame: for if the Dutch have alſo ſeparated from you, this might be an occaſion of repentance vnto you by making you to conſider your wayes more ſeriouſly, and ſo to finde out your ſcandal condemned by the word of God. And the Papiſts, Arians and Anabaptiſts may ſay as wel as you, that <hi>the Dutch Churches have ſeparated from them as well as they have ſeparated from the Dutch.</hi> And this ſerves for a further witneſſe againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If <hi>the word of God came not to Dutch men onely,</hi> as you ſay: then are you for this cheefly to be humbled that have made à ſeparation contrary to that word that came vnto you alſo. And though you acknowledged the Reformed Churches to be true Churches and did dedicate your Confeſſion vnto their vniverſities, yet when they ſaw your ſchiſme publiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, namely that
<note n="f" place="margin">Confeſſ. Art. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>all that wilbe ſaved are bound by Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, with ſpeed to come forth of their Antichriſtian eſtate in the Church of England, &amp;c.</hi> VVhereby you condemned all the godly therein as being in a damnable eſtate, &amp; excluded from ſalvation in that eſtate: when they ſaw many of your exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the Church of England to be ſuch as did alſo neceſſarily lead vnto ſeparation from them, as well as from England, had they not reaſon to avoyd and beware of the new Diſciples of ſuch a ſeparation, as being an vnlawfull aſſemblie eſtabliſhed in Schiſme and not in Chriſte.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that which you alledge concerning their anſwering of your reaſons: namely, that <hi>they would do it, if they ſaw it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or if they found any thing that was worthy of anſwer.</hi> Might they not have their reaſons ſo to anſwer? did they not diſcerne your contentious diſpoſition in other dealings before, as well as afterward, when the deputies both of Dutch and French chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches dealing with your Elderſhip about the cauſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <hi>plaine or direct anſwer from you?</hi> And if there<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22760:34"/>were nothing els, had they not ſome reaſon to ceaſſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them that would not anſwer plainely and directly?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon himſelf writes that
<note n="i" place="margin">Preface to D. B. ſect. 6. Before anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iacob.</note> 
                     <hi>experience the miſtreſse of fooles</hi> teacheth many things, ſo might the Dutch El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip conſider that the ſame ſchoole-miſtreſſe might teach you that, which you would not learne of others; as they may alſo ſee it come to paſſe in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon and the greateſt part of your congregation who have now of themſelves let fal many of thoſe things for which they ſtood ſo eagerly againſt the Dutch heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Your fourth reply is, that <hi>the inſtance of that one man that came vnto you from the French Church, convinceth you no more of ſinfull Separation; then the Dutch Churches receyving ſundry of ſuch as had bene your members convinceth them.</hi> I anſwer, this inſtance was not alledged as an argument to convince the vnlawfulnes and ſin of your ſeparation, but as an anſwer for matter of fact vnto your argument, to illuſtrate your fact in ſeparating from our congregation as you do from the French: &amp; thus it ſhewes as much as it was brought for: namely, that you do not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate onely from the 4. things mentioned by you.</p>
                  <p>In your fift reply, you tel vs 3 of the cauſes for which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cluſe</hi> your Elder left the French Church, viz. their vſe of
<hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane leitourgies, Cathechiſme, &amp; baptiſing ſuch as are not in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Christe, &amp;c.</hi> That for theſe ſins <hi>according to your maine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he left them lawfully, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This ſtory of your Elders ſeparation is imperfectly ſet downe: In the examination of his fact, it were expedient the Reader ſhould know the circumſtances thereof, &amp; how it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in a moſt pregnant and remarkable diſcontment how it was concluded with ſhameful &amp; falſe boaſting: of theſe things I have ample teſtimonie from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>La vigne</hi> the ancient &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend paſtour of that French Church delivered vnto me in the preſence of their Elderſhip which in due time is further to be manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the cauſes of his ſeparation, he alledged alſo the ſet<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22760:34"/>maintenance of their miniſters: their meeting in Idol-temples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their ſuffring of the innocent partie to forgive the offendant that had committed adultery, and to live togather againe: their maner of exerciſing their diſcipline, &amp;c. Touching Idol-te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, he may learne by this writing in defence of our particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that he had no cauſe to ſeparate vpon ſuch a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and as for the reſt of the poynts ſuppoſe they were all ſins as you would have them: yet doth it not follow according to your maine or meane argument, that therfore he ſhould leave their Church: for he did not according to your argument ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>from ſin onely,</hi> but from all that was good amongſt them? and left their whole communion. That being true which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the defence of our Church, Decluſe may hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he hath cauſe to humble himſelf for his offence given vnto the French.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you reply, <hi>that there is in him &amp; you, no other blame to be found then in me and ours, who profeſſe to ſeparate from knowne evilles, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that there be two maine differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, which do make our eſtates to differ as far as Eaſt is from the VVeſt: 1, he and you in juſtifying of him, will have ſuch things to be knowne evilles, as are not evill at all: to wit, ſet maintenance of miniſters: vſe of our temples: the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons reteyning of the repentant adulterer, &amp;c. Theſe we maintaine to be lawfull. 2. he &amp; you in juſtifying of him, for pretended corruptions do vtterly renounce communion, &amp; quite leave a true Church as de hath done: but we on the contrary do not leave communion of true Churches for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions &amp; ſins, according to his example, but onely abſtaine from the practiſe of evil in our owne perſons, and witneſſe againſt it in others, ſtill holding communion with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Vnto my ſecond exception (as you call it; though it be my firſt anſwer onely illuſtrated with your ſeparation from the French Church mentioned before) you reply two things. 1. You ſay, <hi>it is we that have made the ſeparation by gathering a</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:22760:35"/>
                     <hi>new Church apart from you, who were here a Church before vs.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, though it be true that we renounce your ſchiſme &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, yet doth not our gathering of a new Church apart from you, prove the ſame: for it may yet come to paſſe that there ſhalbe an other new Engliſh Church in this citie gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red apart from vs, and yet no ſeparation, but a loving commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion occaſionally miainteyned betwixt vs, though we be here a church before them By ſuch a reaſon as this you might prove that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon and his company ſeparated from you at his firſt comming into this land, becauſe they gathered a new church apart from you in the ſame citie, you being here a Church before them. 2. you ſay, you have <hi>juſt cauſe to cenſure ſuch of yours as come vnto vs both for their ſchiſme</hi> in leaving you: &amp; <hi>for their falling into great evilles, as the renouncing of their holy covenant and profeſsion of ſeparation, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. You cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your people ſometimes not onely for ſeparating from you: and for renouncing their covenant with you, but even for hearing one Sermon with vs, and cutt them off if they make not publique repentance: yea though they heare vs at ſuch a time when you have no exerciſe: And this is a full proofe of that poynt wherevnto I brought it, namely to ſhew the lamenes of your argument, in that you did not ſeparate onely from thoſe 4. things noted by you: but this fault you will not ſee nor acknowledge, though it be moſt palpable. 2. That your people ought to renounce their covenant made among you with profeſſion of ſeparation from the Church of England, it is already ſhewed in thoſe treatiſes which I have nominated vnto you, which if they were duely weighed, the abhomination of your ſchiſme might well be diſcerned notwithſtanding all the libelles which you have ſpread abroad againſt the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>To my third exception, as you reckon it, touching your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the private communion of the godly in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, you reply many things in a heape: that <hi>to convince you of ſin, I bring no one word of God, but would preſſe you with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:22760:35"/>
                     <hi>of men, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, touching your miſreckoning: you deale with me as the Church of Rome in their Catechiſmes doth with the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or 10, Commandements: when they leave out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement which is againſt their Idolatry, yet to keep the number of ten, they divide the laſt commandement &amp; make two of it: ſo when I gave you 3. anſwers to your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you leave out the laſt and omit it altogather, and yet keep the number by dividing the firſt and making two of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when I ſent you here to the writings of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> refuting your private ſchiſme, do not I ſend you to the word of God and ſcriptures which he hath alledged, as is largely to be
<note n="a" place="margin">Relig. Com. from p. 7. to 17.</note> ſeene? How often do you your ſelf in your bookes ſend vs vnto the writings of <hi>H. Barow, and Mr. Iohnſon,</hi> vpbrayding vs for not anſwering of them? yea and furthet to ſhew your blinde partialitie in this complaint, do not you your ſelf in your former
<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> writing ſend me vnto
<hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Robinſons</hi> booke to anſwer it: and why may not I as wel ſend you to the very ſame Author? Nay, not onely ſo, but you ſend me vnto ſuch a booke of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſon</hi> as himſelf doth begin to revoke publiquely as being vnſound in divers thinges, whereas I refer you vnto a later booke of his, made with riper deliberation, and in no part that I heare of, publiquely revoked. His booke which you ſend me vnto, being his
<hi>Iuſtification of ſeparation,</hi> is ſick of King
<note n="c" place="margin">Chro. 21.15.18.19.</note>
                     <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi> incurable diſeaſe, the guttes of it fall out day by day, yea he openly pluckes out ſome of the bowelles thereof with his owne hands: vnto this rotten book you refer me, &amp; yet blame me that refer you vnto that which is more ſound. VVhat equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or honeſty is there, in this dealing?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the <hi>ſetting of you at variance,</hi> it is your ſelves that have done it, yea the Lord in his judgement hath done it: I onely wiſh that you would not ſmother the matter, but ſearch conſcionably for the truth: and ſo I doubt not but it would redound to the
<hi>advantage</hi> of the truth, and of many poore ſoules inſnared in your errour, yea and to your owne advantage<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22760:36"/>at the laſt, by being made an occaſion to finde out the evill of your ſchiſme.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for your now <hi>vrging of me to anſwer</hi> the things that concerne publique communion in this foreſayd book, do you not conſider that vpon the comming forth of this book, there was preſently publiſhed a <hi>Manuduction</hi> for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to lead him vnto publique communion, and this by the ſame perſon that had convinced his private ſeparation to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull? Thoſe that do juſtly weigh thoſe
<hi>Manuductions</hi> may thereby diſcerne his doctrine about publique communion layd downe in that booke, to be already refuted.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, for your vrging of me to anſwer <hi>D. Bilſons and M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> bookes, as wel as I vrge you to anſwer M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon: I anſwer, there is not the like reaſon. 1. There is no miniſter or learned man to anſwer M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon but onely you, <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Iohnſon</hi> being againſt you alſo in this and no proteſtant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the world that holds ſuch an vnchriſtian errour againſt private communion with the godly beſides your ſelf that I can heare of: whereas for the anſwer of D.B. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H. there are many more fit and meet then I am. 2. I were never provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to anſwer theſe men, as you have bene openly in your owne congregation by your owne people deſired and vrged to anſwer <hi>Mr. Robinſon.</hi> 3. The ſubſtance of that which is in thoſe two mens bookes hath bene anſwered already in many writings: the ſubſtance of that which M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Robinſon hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt your private Schiſme, hath not bene refuted by any that I ever heard of.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, to that you ſay, <hi>there be for on of you, a 1000. of vs &amp; moe, to make anſwer, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Though vve be moe then you, yet ſeing you be ſuch men of might, and we but graſhoppers in your ſight: ſeing your people do ſo often take into their mouthes that ſaying of Moſes and apply it to themſelves againſt vs:
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.30.</note> 
                     <hi>one ſhall chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight:</hi> according to this account your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is equivalent vnto our multitude. 2. If we be a 1000.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22760:36"/>to one of you, yet it appeares that one of you have heretofore bene as ready to contend for the ſeparation, as a 1000. of vs have bene to ſtrive againſt it: one of you hath ſtird vp as much contention as a 1000. of vs. Heretofore when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. wrote a book againſt your ſchiſme, ech of you ſtrove to be on his back. M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>.
<hi>Robinſon</hi> pleaded that they had ſpeciall right in the quarrel, and yet you prevented them both and ruſhed into the battel before them: Though then you three came againſt one, yet now when 3. of you are by name called vpon to defend the <hi>vnreaſonablenes of your ſeparation,</hi> in the
<note n="a" place="margin">In the preface:</note> book ſo entitled: there is not one of you appeares: heretofore you were wont to ſnatch vp private letters, broken notes of Sermons and other writings &amp; made ſeveral bookes againſt them, ſtill complayning (as even in your former writing) that you were not anſwered: why do you now begin to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary complaint againſt me? It is your ſelf thay lay lode vpon your owne broad ſhoulders, by ſetting your hand with
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 16.12.</note> Iſmael againſt every man in every Church of Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, though my <hi>writings to you were about Church communion, and your argument alſo concerne the ſame,</hi> yet if in this your argument you bring ſuch a propoſition, the falſhood whereof may be manifeſted by conſideration of your private communion, is there not juſt occaſion to note the ſame? And howſoever you intended your ſpeech touching the inference of publique communion from private, (if it were ſo as you now interpret your ſelf) the diſcuſſing thereof betwixt you would vndoubtedly help to pluck downe the tower of your ſeparation. As for your preſumptuous affirmation, that <hi>it is not poſſible that the principles of your ſeparation which is from ſin onely and communion therewith ſhould ever be ſhaken, ſo long as Gods word endureth,</hi> it is but a puffe of the fleſh: and I would counſell you to beware of ſuch vaine confidence, which might moove the Lord to
<note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> ſmite you with hardnes of heart: yea ſuch preſumption is not onely a mooving cauſe, but alſo a meanes whereby that judgement of obduration is executed:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22760:37"/>for many times when corrupt fleſh hath ſpoken or written vainely &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently, there is a vayle of preiudice &amp; frowardnes ſpread over the heart thereby: a greater vnwillingnes to retract errour is wrought in the heart thereby, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to ſay as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late did in an other caſe,
<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 19.22.</note> 
                     <hi>That which I have written, I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> The word of God is infallible &amp; endureth for ever, but your knowledge of that word is fallible: Thoſe two may not be compared togather: Your ſeparation is built vpon the miſvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that word. VVhether you erre &amp; pervert the word of God in making that to be ſin which is not: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that to be ſeparation from ſin onely, which is alſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from good things, we are to conſider by the examination of the particulars following for which you ſeparate from vs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when you profeſs to ſhew vs your judgement tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching communion with the godly in England, you do wrap vp the matter ſo, that ſimple men may eaſily miſtake you and be deceyved by you: you tell vs that you hold private communion with <hi>ſuch as are come to that meaſure of grace, as that they are worthy in Chriſte, to be receyved into the true viſible Church:</hi> but who be they, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth?</hi> is there any one perſon, man, vvoman, or Child, high or low, that is a member of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and vſes to heare the Sermons of the ſincereſt Miniſter of that Church whoſoever, whom you judge to be worthy in Chriſte to be receyved into the true viſible Church? name any one if you can: Nay I know you can not according to your profeſſion name one; for according to the whole tenour of your vvritings, they are all and every one of them Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yea groſſe Idolatours, carying the marke of the beaſt, and therfore all of them by you debarred from the Church of Chriſte, vntill they renounce that Church and every Miniſter thereof, ſeparating as you have done. But yet you ſay, you will <hi>labour to cheriſh the good things that appeare to be in them:</hi> Now vvhat is your <hi>cheriſhing</hi> of them? you allow them not to heare the faithfulleſt Miniſter of the Land, which might cheriſh them: your ſelf deny all religious communion vnto them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22760:37"/>even in private: you pronounce them all to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath and of the curſe: and teach throughout your vvritings that there is no promiſe of Chriſte in his Goſpell, no hope of ſalvation that belongs vnto them in this their eſtate: This is your <hi>cheriſhing</hi> of them? This your private ſchiſme is confuted by M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſon:</hi> he preſſeth you vvith the vvord of God, vvith the ſcriptures and vvith divine authoritie, though you vvould faine have the reader to imagine othervviſe, by calling for the vvord of God, &amp;c. Vntill you have anſwered the ſcriptures and the reaſons alledged by him, it is needleſſe for me to bring any more. In the meane time I wil endevour to maintaine our Church-eſtate againſt you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE mayn argument for our Separation being thus eſtabliſhed: I now come to the particulars. For the vſe or abuſe of the Lords prayer (ſo called) firſt I mentioned the reading of that part of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a prayer: and with this you meddle not. Secondly I miſliked the ſaying it over by rote, as is the faſhion of many. To this you ſay, if I mean without vnderſtanding and feeling, you condemne that alſo. I anſwer, I meane not that onely: for men may alſo read it, yea may read humane leitourgies with vnderſtanding and feeling, and yet offend in ſo praying: other things are requiſite to true prayer beſides vnderſtanding and feeling. I mean therfore by rote, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner, without book: when men having committed it to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, ſay it over for their prayer, after they have prayed by the ſpirit; as God inabled them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly I granted a lawfull and holy uſe of that or any other part of ſcripture in our prayers, as the Spirit of God leadeth us to any of them.</hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                        <hi>You ſay, your manner is ordinarily before or after every Sermon, to conclude your prayers with the Lords prayer: after you have prayed by the help of the Spirit, you perſuade your ſelves that you alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by the help of the ſame Spirit.</hi>

And in ſpeech with my ſelf, about the ſame time, before two that came with him, he ſignified his diſlike of reading prayers, without any ſuch limitation as you allege. But if he taught as I heard it related, it was but the trueth: from which your contrary judgement ſwarveth.

                     <p>Your maine argument for ſeparation from ſin onely vvill then be eſtabliſhed vvhen you have proved all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things vvhich you blame in vs, to be ſin: and that you ſeparate from them onely: vntill ſuch time, you do here in vaine flatter your ſelf that your
<hi>maine argument is eſtabliſhed:</hi> The truth and force of that general reaſon depends vpon the particulars vvhich vve now come to examine. Touching our queſtion about the vſe or abuſe of the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the firſt place, how <hi>you mentioned the reading of that part of ſcripture for a prayer:</hi> and therevpon you note, that <hi>with this I meddle not.</hi> I anſwer, 1. The reaſon why I ſpoke not of <hi>reading that prayer</hi> out of the booke, vvas becauſe we do not in our Church ſo vſe to read it on a booke, but vtter it vvithout a booke as vve do the other part of our prayers going before:<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22760:38"/>Now the queſtion layd downe before betwixt you and me at this time is touching the practiſe of our particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therfore it is you rather that go beſide the queſtion in this your mentioning of it. 2. Seing the reading of it vpon a book and vttring of it for our prayer without a book are both of them actions of like nature: ſeing the reaſons in your apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie againſt our vſe of this prayer are expreſſely and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently directed as well againſt the reading of this prayer, as againſt the ſaying of it by rote, (as you call it:) and there is no thing that is there diſtinctly ſpoken more againſt the one then the other: when I then vndertooke to refute thoſe reaſons in your Apologie, did I not therein alſo vndertake to maintaine the reading of that prayer againſt you? who ſees not now, that your firſt note in this place is but a trifeling obſervation. 3 I deſire the readers to looke back into the former part of our writings touching this poynt, both mine and yours: to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them togather: and then to judge who it is that hath winked and paſſed by the evills obiected about this matter, and namely, beſide other things the ſlanderous and vngodly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of H. Barow touching our vſe of the Lords prayer.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, you explane your meaning of that phraſe of <hi>ſaying by rote,</hi> contrary to the common acception of the word, of ſaying it <hi>not onely without vnderstanding and feeling, but of ſaying it after the common maner, without booke, &amp;c.</hi> you grant that
<hi>men may alſo reade it, yea and other humane leitourgies with vnderſtanding and feeling, and yet offend in ſo praying:</hi> your reaſon is; <hi>other things are requiſite to true prayer beſides vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and feeling.</hi> But what are thoſe other things which cannot be reduced vnto theſe two? vnderſtanding conteyneth vnder it the knowledge of God, his wiſedome, power, love, truth and other attributes: his gracious covenant in Chriſte, his law, his workes, &amp;c. Likewiſe the knowledge both of our neighbours eſtate and our owne, our ſins, miſeries, deliverances, &amp;c. Vnder feeling joyned with knowledge, are comprehended the feeling of Gods mercy in Chriſte by a lively faith: the ſenſe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:22760:39"/>comforts by a lively hope: the feeling of our neighbours eſtate by true love and compaſſion and joy for him: the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our owne ſins, miſeries, baſenes, by true and godly ſorow, humilitie, &amp;c. Herevpon I do thus reaſon againſt you from your owne grant: That prayer which is vttred with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, hope, love, humility, &amp;c. is acceptable unto God, &amp; ought to be approved of Men. But the Lords prayer is by vs vttred with knowledge, faith, hope, love, humility, &amp;c. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is acceptable to God, and ought to be approved. The firſt propoſition is manifeſt from the

<note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> ſame place, that the ſaying of this prayer by rote even in the worſt ſenſe without feeling and vnderſtanding could be no warrant for the people to ſeparate from vs, though it ſhould be our ſin ſo to vſe it: to this alſo you give no reply but paſs by it as if it had not bene written, though I was inſtant with you, and ſhewed that about this poynt onely our queſtion was, &amp;c. further whereas in your fotmer
<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> writing you confeſſe that for the vſe of the Lords prayer among vs, you have not layd it downe as a cauſe of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing communion with vs, &amp;c. If you be ſtill of the ſame minde (as you have not yet declared the contrary though you have bene ſo earneſtly mooved to declare your meaning herein) then may you plainely diſcerne your ſeparation overthrowne hereby in reſpect of many of thoſe cauſes that you do pretend for the ſame: for if our vſe of the Lords prayers be vnlawful: if it be a tranſgreſſion contrary to the word of God and to ſo many ſcriptures as you do alledge to impugne the ſame: then why do you not ſeparate for it, as well as for other ſin which you impute vnto vs? as you approve not other things among vs, ſo neither do you approve this; how can you without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality give your ſelf a diſpenſation to hold communion with vs notwithſtanding this ſin, rather then others? as for example, when you do maintaine your Elder Iohn Decluſe ſeparating from the French Church for their baptiſing ſome Children which you hold ought not to be baptiſed, how could you have allowed him to have held communion with them vſing the Lords prayer in your judgement contrary to the ſcriptures as well as the former? ſo for other read prayers: for celebration of Mariages in the Church, and the like, how can you alledge them as cauſes of ſeparation, rather then this ſaying of the Lords prayer by rote, as you ſpeak? Suppoſe you hold th' other to be greater ſins then this, yet vvill not that cleare you: for 1, a good conſcience vvill take heed of being defiled

<note n="g" place="margin">Exo. 20.7 Numb. 4.15.</note> holy thing is the greater ſin: if our vſe of the Lords prayer be a ſin, then muſt it needes in this regard be a greater ſin, then the vſe of other ſet formes of prayer written by men: in as much as it is a greater ſin to abuſe the vvords of Chriſt then the words of other men. 3, ſeing this abuſe of the Lords prayer (as you account it) is far more frequent then that baptiſing, and celebration of mariages which you alledge as cauſes of refuſing communion with the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſeing that evilles
<note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 59.12.

                           <p>Firſt, this reaſon is inconſequent: becauſe, though the maner and forme of true prayer be there taught by Chriſte, that hinders not, but the ſame words may be our prayer alſo: One and the ſame patterne or forme of a thing doth often ſerve both for preſent vſe in the work wherevnto it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and for imitation to make the like: As a juſt weight or balance ſerves both for our preſent vſe to weigh with all, and alſo for a patterne to make an other like the ſame by it.

                           <p>VVe do not contend that the ſame words and number of words in the Lords prayer are alwayes preciſely and of neceſſity to be vſed, but we hold that it is lawfull to vſe them as our prayer, either with or without ſuch changes as are to be noted in the Evangeliſts recording them. If we preciſely follow Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, it is no offence to Luke: If we vſe the words as they are in Luke, it is no offence againſt Mathew: If we vary in phraſe from both of them, it may be without offence to either: our tenent is, that either the ſame words or to the ſame purpoſe may lawfully be vſed of vs. And therfore this reaſon is wholly beſide the queſtion.</p>

                           <p>3. <hi>Becauſe all the circumſtances in both the Evangeliſts do lead vs thus to vnderstand it. As namely, that Chriſt there ſheweth the right maner how to vſe prayer, like as he doth for the right vſe of almes &amp; faſting: how to avoyd ambition, hypocriſie, babling, and the like therein: how alſo to come to God in prayer, as Children do to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, aſking bread, an egge, fiſh, or the like: that is, making requeſts vnto God according to our particular wants, in faith, hope, love, &amp;c.

                           <p>This argument is a mere aſſertion and moſt falſe, without any proofe. There is no circumſtance in either of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts that leads vs to think we may not vſe the Lords prayer as a prayer. It can not be ſhewed that this vſe of it, doth make vs guilty of ambition, hypocriſy or babling: or that in this vſe we can not come vnto God with feeling of our particular wants as Children do to their parents: or that in this vſe of it there can not be the practiſe of faith, hope, love, &amp;c. All this remaines to be proved, vntill which time this argument might well for ſhame have hidden his head, and pluckt in theſe hornes of ſlander by which it puſheth at all the Saincts in the Reformed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22760:41"/>Churches for their dayly publique &amp; private vſe of this prayer, ſhutting them vp vnder the condemnation of Ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hypocrites, Bablers; as being without feeling of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wants: without faith, hope and love in their vſe of this prayer.

                           <p>4. <hi>Becauſe the Apoſtles (who both knew and carefully followed the true meaning of Chriſt herein) did neither bynd themſelves to theſe words, but prayed ſtill as they had ſeverall occaſions, according to this rule</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.24.25. <hi>&amp;</hi>

                           <p>Firſt, though the Apoſtles did not binde themſelves to theſe words, yet doth not this prove, that they never vſed the ſame as their prayer: they might pray according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions, according to this rule, and yet with the words of the rule. The miniſters of Chriſt do here vſe to pray accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall occaſions, and yet with the words of this prayer alſo.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, though we read not in their writings, that they did in expreſſe words teach men to ſay over the Lords prayer, yet we reade that by their example in their writings they did as much in teaching men other ſet formes of prayer in their ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and valedictions: as appeares, <hi>Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.3. 2 Cor. 1.2. Gal. 1.3. Eph. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. 1 Theſ. 1.1. 2 Theſ. 1.2. Rom. 16.23. 1 Cor. 16.23. Phil. 4.23. 1 Theſ. 5.28. 2 Theſ. 3.18.</hi> At ſeveral times vvriting vpon divers occaſions and vnto divers people, Paul yet (we ſee) vſed the ſame forme of prayer, &amp; the ſame words: And this is al one as if he had ſo many times vſed the Lords prayer: for vvherfore ſhould it be more vnlawfull to vſe the Lords prayer often, then to vſe theſe formes of words ſo often for his prayer.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, though the Apoſtles taught men according to their neceſsities and occaſions to ſhew their requeſts vnto God in all maner prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit with giving of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:22760:42"/>thanks, with watchfullnes and perſeverance, yet this hinders not but that they might vſe the Lords prayer &amp; other like ſet formes of prayer alſo: for the vſe of the Lords prayer as a prayer doth not deſtroy ſupplication in the Spirit, nor overthrow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in prayer. Think you not, that there are many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt vſing to conclude their prayers with the Lords prayer, that yet watch with all perſeverance to ſhew their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts vnto God in all maner prayer, as well as your ſelf, or any of your ſeparated people?

                           <p>Firſt, the Lords prayer might be vſed often as a prayer in the Church of Corinth, and yet the vnlearned among them not be able to ſay Amen vnto theſe that ſpake ſtrange languages of whom the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh: becauſe theſe men were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prophets and did at ſome times by a ſpeciall gift ſpeak other tongues and ſtrange languages. And therfore the Apoſtle might have replyed againe to any vnlearned that ſhould have anſwered as you ſuppoſe and feigne: Nay, though the Lords prayer be vſed ordinarily among you, in your owne ſpeech, yet you know not what theſe extraordinary Prophets ſay, which come with new revelations in a ſtrange tongue vnto you and therfore you can not ſay Amen vnto their prayers: ſo that I have ſtill juſt cauſe to ſpeak againſt their prayers in a ſtrange tongue.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the Corinthian Prophets had ſometimes <pb n="73" facs="tcp:22760:42"/>vſed the Lords prayer in a ſtrange tongue, yet this might have bene ſo ſeldome and at ſuch times that the vnlearned could not perceyve or vnderſtand the ſame: This ſeldome and rare vſe of it, though it might be a ſufficient teſtimony how lawfull they held it to be for their prayer, yet could it not be ſufficient to enable the vnlearned to ſay Amen vnto it.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe theſe extraordinary Prophets had ſo often &amp; ordinarily vſed the Lords prayer in a ſtrange tongue, that all the vnlearned could have diſcerned when the Prophets repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame yet doth it not follow that they could in lawfull maner have ſayd Amen vnto it: Becauſe the lawfull and right ſaying of Amen, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes requires not onely a confuſed knowledge, that the Lords prayer is ſayd over at ſuch a time: but alſo a diſtinct vnderſtanding of the ſeverall words therein, that their hearts and affections might go along with him that vſed the ſame, and ſo at length in the concluſion ſignify and witneſſe their conſent by ſaying Amen vnto it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, it is to be obſerved how <hi>H. Barow</hi> though vpon a moſt abſurd pretence doth yet in a contrary extremity contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this your Apologie: whiles he affirmeth touching our vſe of the Lords prayer, even in our mother-tongue: that <hi>it doth not edify the whole congregation, ſo that they may all minde one thing, or ſay Amen.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Diſcov. p. 70.73.</note> If it be true which he ſaith, that men vſing it in their vulgar tongue, can not yet ſay Amen vnto it: how can it be true which your Apologie ſaith, that they which occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the place of the vnlearned may ſay Amen vnto it; eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when it is vſed in a ſtrange tongue?</p>
                           <p>Fiftly, if the people can ſay Amen vnto the Lords prayer, when the words thereof are vſually ſayd over, as your Apologie here affirmeth: do you not hereby overthrow your owne aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in denying our vſe of it? for can we ſay Amen vnto an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull prayer, which is not ſupplication in the Spirit; which is not made with feeling of our wants, in faith, hope, &amp;c?

Common vſe of ſpeech teacheth vs to make an other conſtruction of his wordes: for as a man that ſends his Servant on a meſſage, and commandes him when he comes vnto his friend to ſpeak <hi>on this maner</hi> and to <hi>ſay,</hi> &amp;c. doth thereby ordinarily warrant him either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſame words verbatim, or els the ſame matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the meſſage though with ſome change and variety of words and phraſes. And as it were then a ſtrange thing that he ſhould be accounted a diſobedient and vnfaithfull ſervant that ſhould vſe the very words of his maiſter without any change at all: ſo is it with the commandements of Chriſte. For example: Chriſt ſending his Apoſtles and commanding them a forme of prayer for ſalutation, when they came into any houſe, to ſay,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.5.</note> 
                              <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> doth thereby warrant them either to vſe the ſame words verbatim, or the ſame in ſubſtance: And either way his commandement was fulfilled. The holy Ghoſt preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a forme of praiſe to ſay alwayes,

                           <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay: <hi>The heads themſelves are ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as no man can well for himſelf or others vſe them aright without ſome ſpeciall relation or application to his or their particular eſtate or occaſions:</hi> This is both falſe and inconſequent: 1. This is falſe, for even in a generall reſpect and love of Gods name, kingdom and will, we may well and lawfully vſe the words of this prayer, though for the preſent our thoughts doe not light and ſettle vpon the conſideration of the particular meanes and wayes, whereby his name is ſanctifyed, his will accompliſhed, &amp;c.

This is inconſequent: for ſuppoſe it were vnlawfull to vſe this prayer vvithout ſome ſpeciall relation or application there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of to our particular occaſions, yet what hinders but that in the vſe of the very words of this prayer, we may alſo ſometimes vpon occaſion have relation to our particular ſins and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, &amp; to the particular meanes of glorifying God, though the words be generall which we vſe.</p>

                           <p>8. <hi>Els why ſhould not the miniſters be as well bound at the end of their Sermons, and all Magiſtrates and people at their inſtructions &amp; exhortations given vnto others, to ſay over the ten Commandements, becauſe they do fully and ſhortly compriſe all dueties.</hi>

                           <p>Firſt, our queſtion is about the lawfulnes, not about the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of vſing this prayer: we do not ſay that miniſters are bound to ſay over the Lords prayer at the end of every Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: much leſſe do we ſay that all Magiſtrates and people are bound to vſe it at the end of their inſtructions and exhortations: and thus this argument fayleth in the ground of that compariſon from whence it is taken.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, what law of God forbiddeth miniſters to repeat the 10. Commandements at the end of their Sermons? For the Miniſters of theſe Reformed Churches, there are divers of them vvhich do ordinarily vpon the Lords day before their<pb n="78" facs="tcp:22760:45"/>exerciſe of Catechizing, repeate the 10. Commandements, &amp; what is their ſin in this? If judges and Magiſtrates who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be keepers of the Decalogue ſhould with the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition hereof, either begin or conclude their publique and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne charges and exhortations which at certaine times they give vnto people, vvho can condemne them for it? If Maiſters of families ſhould every day begin or conclude their family inſtructions with rehearſall of the 10. Commandements, ſhould not this be a teſtimony of their obedience to Gods
<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 6.7 8.9.</note> law, rather then a tranſgreſsion thereof?</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, there is no equality nor juſt proportion in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon: The vviſedome of God in his word teacheth vs ſhort formes of prayer for ſalutation in 2 or 3 words, becauſe vve have every day and hovver occaſion to vſe them: And ſeing in like maner there is dayly and hovverly occaſion of mutuall exhortation, though it were an abſurd and vnreaſonable thing contrary to the wiſedome of God, to conclude ech ſalutation &amp; exhortation with the Lords prayer and 10. Commandements, more then an 100. times in a week, yet doth it not follow that it is vnlawfull or inconvenient once or twiſe in a week ſo to begin or conclude a ſolemne exerciſe in the Church of God.</p>

                           <p>9. <hi>Seing it is a moſt perfect forme of prayer, wherein is no want or ſuperfluity, if it were Chriſtes meaning to enjoyne the ſaying over of thoſe words for our prayer to God, then ought we to vſe theſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and no other.

                           <p>Firſt, touching the type and ceremony wherein this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is grounded: God doth not by <hi>Malachie</hi> denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the curſe againſt thoſe which refuſed to offer the beſt ſacrifice which they had, but againſt thoſe that offred corrupt contrary to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:22760:45"/>law which required a ſacrifice
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 1.3.10. &amp; 3.1. &amp;
4.3.23.</note> without blemiſh: againſt thoſe eſpecially which were hypocrites and deceyvers, pretending love of God and yet brought corrupt things,

                              <hi>torne, lame and ſick, &amp;c.</hi> A man that had a Kow and 2 Sheep was not bound to offer his Kow, but might lawfully reteyne the ſame and enjoy the bleſsing
<note n="d" place="margin">Eſa. 7.21 22.</note> promiſed of God vnto his people. A poore man that had 10. Sheep, and ſome of them thriſe ſo good as the reſt, was not bound to offer the beſt: the law onely required he ſhould offer that which was not corrupt. Yea in ſome kinde of ſervices, as in tithes, God would not have the beſt to be choſen out for him, but
<note n="e" place="margin">Levit. 27.32.33.</note> would have that which paſſed vnder the rod, the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> as it came by tale, and this without change, the better might not be given to God in ſtead of the worſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, beſide your errour in the ſtory of this ceremony, conſider alſo how you erre in the application of this type vnto the queſtion in hand. If you will have it to ſerve your turne, you muſt prove that all prayers beſides the Lords prayer are corrupt things, like the lame and torne ſacrifices: for this place doth not prove that the excellency of one ſacrifice did exclude an other which hath not the ſame degree and meaſure of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but onely the corrupt and no other.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, marke the contradiction of this argument with the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> &amp; 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> reaſons going before: here you wil have the Lords prayer being commanded to be <hi>without ſuperfluity:</hi> &amp; all others joyned with it to be but babling: before you complayned and pleaded againſt the vſe of it, becauſe no mans or Churches caſe and vnderſtanding could reach vnto ſo many things as were compriſed in it: And is not this to condemne it of ſuperfluity? Here you argue that no other but it alone muſt be vſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo abſolute and ſufficient, having <hi>no want</hi> in it: before you pleaded againſt the vſe of it becauſe it did not ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our particular wants and neceſsities: And is not this to condemne it for the defects thereof?

                  <p>VVHereas I had ſhewed your folly and ſin in raſh condemning of that thing, which afterwards you begin at laſt to enquire of; for this you bring an excuſe or two in vaine: Firſt, you ſay, we

Againe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:22760:47"/>you ſay, that <hi>queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be aſked not onely to informe our ſelves, but to convince others by their owne anſwers, which alſo was your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp;c.</hi> But I anſwer, there is a further matter to be obſerved in your dealing, who make inquiry about ſuch things as you are ignorant of both for matter of right and of the fact it ſelf, and yet affirme ſo much concerning the ſame, as that you make your ſelf guilty of great errour and ſlander, as appeares in the next Chapter where you plead againſt the maner of my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and do moſt faſly alledge the acts of Synods touching the ſame matter.</p>
                  <p>The maine reaſon you bring to prove the vnlawfulnes of my preſent eſtate and of my miniſtery, is this, that <hi>having bene a publique miniſter in one of their Pariſhes in England, I did by the ordinary calling there, adminiſter by an other leitourgie then Chriſts Teſtament, even by their book of common prayer, impoſed on all the Pariſhes,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>I ought to repent of that, as of other ſins wherein there I walked.

                  <p>Firſt, your reaſon from my being a publique miniſter there, to ſhew my adminiſtration by the book of common prayer is inſufficient: for there have bene many publique miniſters in the Church of England that have not bene vrged to read the book of common prayer: though it be impoſed on all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, yet hath it not heretofore bene impoſed on all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in every pariſh. There be in many Pariſhes two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and formerly it hath bene required no further, then that one of them ſhould vſe the ſame: And ſo was it in the pariſh from whence I came into theſe countries, where an other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter did ordinarily vſe the ſame, ſo that it was not impoſed on me. Though you may except that I was partaker of that worſhip, or did vpon occaſion vſe that booke, yet alwayes this ſhewes the vnſoundnes and vntruth of your collection tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my particular adminiſtration by the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas you write here how I have <hi>let paſse the reaſons wherevnto you referred me in your former argument, diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> 
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:22760:48"/>
                     <hi>the adminiſtration by that leitourgie, &amp;c.</hi> It is enough that I ſhew the falſhood of your argument in that you ſeparate from our congregation, and therfore not from ſin onely as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in your argument: This I ſhew by manifeſting the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your reaſons touching thoſe pretended corruptions and want of repentance which you impute vnto vs for a ground of your ſeparation from vs. And therfore though you tell me ten times oftner of letting paſſe thoſe reaſons which you referd me vnto as a deviſe to draw me from the preſent queſtion layd downe betwixt vs, yet ſhall you be diſappoynted of your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herein.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe I had ſinned either in the vſe of the book of common prayer in my owne adminiſtration or by allowing it in others, yet ſo long as this ſin is onely of ignorance, and I know it not to be ſin: the want of particular repentance in this caſe doth not make my preſent miniſtery vnlawfull. By this reaſon of yours there ſhould be no lawfull miniſtery vpon earth, ſeing there is no miniſter whoſoever but he hath ſome ſins which are vnknowne vnto him, even as
<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 19.12 &amp; 40.12. &amp;
139.24.</note> David,
<note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 17.9.</note> Ieremy,
<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4</note> Paul, with other Prophets and Apoſtles: If they knew them not, then could they not have particular repentance for them they could not bring a particular ſacrifice for their particular treſpaſſes till they were
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 4.14 23.28.</note> knowne vnto them: Now by your reaſoning they were all of them in an vnlawfull eſtate, and were not allowed of God to declare his ſtatutes. If you tell me that my ſin of vnlawfull miniſterie in the Church of England is made knowne vnto me by your writings, that I deny: I may as well and better tell you of your ſinfull ſchiſme and ſlander of that Church made knowne vnto you by divers treatiſes which I named before vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſuppoſe I had bene convicted of an vnlawfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in England, and would not repent of the ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vnto me, though this would provoke the Lord againſt me, yet could not this be a ſufficient warrant for you to diſclaime our communion as vnlawfull and polluted. The holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<pb n="85" facs="tcp:22760:48"/>teach vs otherwiſe: though the Sonnes of Eli were wicked and
<note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.12-25.</note> vnrepentant Miniſters of the tabernackle in Shiloh, yet were not the godly taught to refuſe communion with them, but ſtill
<note n="f" place="margin">Ibid. Chap. 1.3. &amp; 3.1.</note> frequented the place of publique worſhip where they adminiſtred. The Miniſters of the temple in Chriſtes time were
<note n="g" place="margin">Luk 7.30 Ioh 7.32.</note> wicked perſons refuſing to repent of thoſe ſins whereof they were convinced by Chriſte, and yet he taught not his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to forſake or diſclayme their communion but both
<note n="h" place="margin">Luk 17.14. Mat. 8.4.</note> ſent others and
<note n="i" place="margin">Luk 22 8 joh. 18.20</note> went himſelf to joyne in the publique worſhip of God with them.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if the not renouncing of my former calling in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland do make me a falſe and vnlawfull Miniſter here, then are the miniſters of theſe Reformed Churches vnlawful Miniſters alſo being acceſſary and partakers with me of that pretended ſin which you impute vnto me, becauſe themſelves occaſionally do communicate with the miniſtery of England when they travel thither, and allow of my preſent eſtate without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation thereof, giving me the right hand of fellowſhip herein. Now then ſeing thoſe that
<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 22.20.</note> conſent vnto other mens ſins, that
<note n="l" place="margin">Eſa. 5.14.</note> rejoyce with them, that
<note n="m" place="margin">pſ. 50.18.</note> ſee a theef and run with him, that

<note n="o" place="margin">joſh. 22.16 17.18.</note> ſee Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and favour them, do hereby enwrap themſelves in the ſame condemnation: how comes it that you do not vpon this ground alſo renounce and diſclaime the communion of theſe vnrepentant Miniſters of the Reformed Churches? If this ground of renunciation be good why do you not alſo vſe it as a motive to ſtay ſuch of your people as do from time to time leave you &amp; come vnto them &amp; vs? How can you approve them for true Miniſters more then me, if thus they partake with me? I write not theſe things to juſtify my eſtate by theirs as you vſe to deprave me, but to reprove &amp; convince your partiall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, by this reaſoning you do yet further ſhew your nakednes vnto vs. If communion with vnrepentant Miniſters is to be forſaken: then theſe Miniſters of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:22760:49"/>being by you admoniſhed of
<note n="p" place="margin">jnquir. of Th. white p. 78.79.</note> eleven ſeverall tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherein they continue without repentance, and in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in the vſe of ſuch read prayers as are in your account a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Idolatrous leitourgie, ought by their people to be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for feare of polluting their ſoules with ſin. If this be ſo, then you holding theſe people yet for your brethren, are bound by the law of God to warne them of this their vncleane communion. According to your owne doctrine you muſt be the onely pure and vnpolluted Angell in all the Churches of Chriſt, and of all the Angels of the Churches beſides, not one that may be lawfully communicated withall: name, if you can, any one miniſter either paſtour or teacher in the whole world with whom you dare communicate in the Lords ſupper, or heare a Sermon from them, and alſo can do it without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion of your owne doctrine. You being then ſuch a rare and extraordinary Angel, doth it not become you, to

                     <hi>ſtand in the Sun,</hi> and openly with a loud voice to cry vnto the Chriſtians in every nation, and kinred and tongue and people that they beware and take heed of their polluted and vnlawfull miniſters leaſt they be defiled by them? There was a promiſe or a ſhew made ſome
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Catal. Francof. An<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o. 1608. Tractatus de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione. Ambſtero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dami apud Cornelium Nicolai in 8.</note> yeares ſince, that your book of the <hi>Communion of ſainctes</hi> ſhould have come forth in Latine at Franckfurdt Mart: but it was a falſe ſhew and a mockery of the world: it is not yet come forth: But had it then bene printed, your doctrine is couched therein ſo cloſely &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, that none who knew you not before, could have found out your meaning thereby. If you will keep a good conſcience in the profeſsion of that truth which you think is revealed vnto you, you are then
<note n="t" place="margin">Levit. 19.17.</note> plainely to admoniſh your brethren: to
<note n="u" place="margin">Eſa. 8.1.</note> take a great rolle and write in it with a mans pen, <hi>make ſpeed to ſeparate, make hast to renounce all your ministers:</hi> you are to
<note n="x" place="margin">Hab. 2.2.</note> write the viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſeparation, and to make it plaine vpon tables, that he may run, that readeth it. At leaſt wiſe, you ought to admoniſh theſe many members of the Dutch and French Churches herein the ſame city with you and to prove vnto
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:22760:49"/>them plainely and clearely this maine poynt that they ought to refuſe communion with their vnrepentant Miniſters. VVe accuſe the pope of great cruelty in that he profeſſeth he hath power to deliver al the Soules out of Purgatory, if he would: and yet will not do it: And we accuſe you likewiſe of great cruelty, as wanting bowelles of compaſſion and brotherly love in that you profeſs to ſee a holy &amp; vndefiled path of Chriſtian communion: and yet ſeeing ſo many thouſands of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren dayly before your eyes to walk in an vncleane path that pollutes their Soules, will not for all this ſhew them the good way and ſet vp markes vnto them that they may walk in it. As you found meanes to publiſh your confeſſion both in Latine and Dutch, ſo if you had zeale and conſcience of this doctrine that you profeſſe, you could ſoone finde meanes to publiſh a few argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in Dutch &amp; Latine alſo to call away the faithfull people in this city where you live from their vnlawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Iudgement, mercy and fidelity are the
<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note> cheef matters of Gods law, which ought cheefly to be done: but either you want aſſurance of the truth in that you profeſſe, or els you want Chriſtian love and compaſsion, which will not ſhew the way of truth &amp; peace vnto thoſe that go aſtray: eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is none to do it but your ſelf: conſidering alſo that you can finde time to publiſh ſundry other things, which in all reaſon ſhould not ſo much touch your conſcience. Think on theſe things in the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, this your doctrine of ſchiſme leads vs to ſee more of your partiality: for if communion with vnrepentant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is to be refuſed: then how could you hitherto allow your people to hold communion with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon</hi> who repents not of that ſin which you impute vnto him. In your judgement he is a teacher of falſe doctrine, and a practiſer of the ſame, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding private communion with Antichriſtian Idolatours, and members of a falſe Church as you eſteeme them: he openly perſiſteth herein and drawes many with him to this practiſe; &amp; this alſo when as he had once condemned this courſe he takes<pb n="88" facs="tcp:22760:50"/>and written againſt the ſame, ſo that he is alſo an Apoſtate and a decliner from the truth formerly profeſſed as you take it: and yet you have not renounced his communion. Behold then the balances of deceit and partiality in your hand: even the falſe balances that are an
<note n="y" place="margin">Prov. 11.1, &amp;. 20,10</note> abhomination to the Lord: as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull merchant you vſe one weight and meaſure in dealing with him, an other when you have to do with vs even about the ſame matter; he though an vnrepentant miniſter is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed and reiected by you, as others are, Is this to walk with a right foote vnto the truth of the Goſpell, or rather to halt downe right in the pathes of hypocriſie and diſſimulation? Your ſeparation is a ſin great enough of it ſelf, though it were maintayned of mere ignorance, but when ſuch partialitie is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto it, your ſin becomes more ſinfull, &amp; the burden of it more greevous.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, as in the former anſwers, your ſins of falſe doctrine cruelty and partiality vvere manifeſted, ſo in this place you are for them to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This is the fruit of your owne arguing, God allowes not ſuch to declare his ſtatutes as continue in ſin, &amp; therfore your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is to be refuſed: Thus doth your foote ſlide into the pit that you digd for others.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, according to this your reaſoning is the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn Decluſe</hi> your elder to be avoyded alſo. His iniurious &amp; falſe dealing in the

                  <p>And note here <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth,</hi> that you cannot help your ſelf in this ſtraite by any diſtinction of ſins that you can make. For when as
<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 44. &amp; Fol. 3. B.</note> before to prove the firſt propoſition of your maine argument, namely that
<hi>the ſeparation which is onely from ſin and communion therewith is of God and all good mens duety:</hi> you there alledge all the the ten Commandements at once <hi>Exo. 20. Eph. 5.11. 2 Cor. 6.14.15.16.</hi> You do hereby cut of your ſelf from any refuge or evaſion by putting difference betwixt ſin. For whether they be ſins of conſtitution, or ſins of publique worſhip, or adminiſtration, or whether they be other perſonall particular ſins whatſoever, yet are they all forbidden in the 10. Commandements: they are all vnproffitable workes of darknes: they are all an vncleane thing not to be touched: and therfore making thoſe places the ground of your ſeparation from a Church or from the miniſters thereof: you do alike without exception make any ſin of what kinde ſoever, litle or great to be a warrant for ſeparation when as it is openly knowne and tolerated without redreſſe. Conſider what a large ſeparation you do make hereby: even ſuch a one as will lead you to ſeparate from all Churches: ſuch an one as you are never like to keep a good conſcience in the profeſſion thereof: ſuch an one as leads all your people to ſeparate both from you and your elder <hi>Decluſe</hi> both in reſpect of the former ſins here noted, and in reſpect of many more publique offences which I could manifeſt in you both.</p>

If theſe things be ſo, then have you no cauſe to complaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the writings which beare witneſſe of ſuch ſins among you, to be <hi>libelles,</hi> but rather to yeeld that they are wholeſome and neceſſary warnings to keep every Chriſtian man from ſuch a contagious and polluted communion.</p>
                  <p>In the xi. place, it is not vnmeet to obſerve and remember here, that you who are ſo hard and vnrighteous a judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of all true Churches and miniſters, are yet further guilty of ſuch ſinnes as though they were repented of, yet do they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne profeſſion leave ſo deep a blott &amp; ſtaine<pb n="91" facs="tcp:22760:51"/>vpon you as that they make you vncapable of the miniſtery, &amp; vnlawfull to be choſen by any people vnto ſo holy a work. For if the Church of England be ſuch a falſe church, ſuch a Babylon and Egipt as you vvould make it: if their worſhip be ſuch groſſe and abhominable Idolatry, as
<note n="e" place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poy. from pag. 127. to

Tit. 1.5.7. and 2.15. 1 Tim. 4.12.</note> vnreproveable as the ſtewards of God; that ſo they might the better ſpeak, exhort and convince with all authoritie, and ſee that no man deſpiſe them. But as thoſe that have bene blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſhame of murder, adulteries, or Theftes after they have profeſſed the Goſpell, are vnmeet to be choſen miniſters for the rebuking of leſſer ſins, when themſelves are ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly guilty of greater; ſo thoſe
<hi>Apoſtates</hi> &amp; backſliders which after they have receyved the knowledge of the truth, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the falſe Church do againe fall back vnto Idolatrie and this divers times, do in like maner deprive themſelves of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being called vnto the publique miniſtery of the Goſpel. Now you being ſuch an Apoſtata as according to your preſent profeſſion have ſundry times turned back vnto the Idolatrous falſe Church, as hath bene by divers perſons witneſſed, neither could <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Let it be well obſerved that you are thus noted to have turned your coate &amp; changed your religion <hi>five</hi> ſeverall times, namely, <hi>firſt</hi> being of our religion and a member of the church of England you forſook that Church and ſeparated: <hi>Secondly,</hi> that being ſeparated, you did againe in
<hi>London</hi> being in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of authoritie yeeld to joyne with the worſhip and miniſtery of the Church of England: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that after this you did againe ſlide back vnto the ſeparation and renounce the Church of<pb n="92" facs="tcp:22760:52"/>England: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that after this when you were in <hi>Ireland</hi> and in ſome danger of puniſhment for your ſcandal, you did againe returne vnto the communion renounced by you, whether fainedly or vnfainedly, I leave vnto your ſelf to conſider:
<hi>Fiftly,</hi> after this you change your profeſſion againe and fall back vnto ſeparation, and ſtick now preſently in this Schiſme: and thus whiles by this often revolting you diſhonour and diſable your ſelf and your miniſtery, you will yet exalt your ſelf above all the Miniſters of Chriſt in the world, and by your profeſsion maintaine that your ſelf onely may be joyned vnto, and that no other Miniſter may lawfully be heard: &amp; if this be not ſo, I pray you name who and how many there be that you durſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your people to communicate with all. Is it not a rare and an extraordinary thing that ſuch a ſcandalous and vnſtable apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata ſhould yet notwithſtanding maintaine ſuch a ſeparation from all the faithfull Miniſters of the Lord, and therein boaſt of your owne onely lawfull eſtate? Think not that I write theſe things in any hatred of your perſon which I love: but for your good, for your humbling and the warning of others: I think ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that it ſhould be my ſin if vpon ſo juſt occaſion I ſhould conceale this work of God vpon you in judging and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing your ſchiſme by giving you vp vnto theſe offenſive and ſtrange revolts, when as himſelf would have ſuch

                  <p n="12">XII, not to inſiſt vpon many other things that might ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate this your ſcandall, when as you were thus ſtayned with apoſtaſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as at this ſame time it was the profeſſion of your Church not to admit ſuch apoſtates into office among you: when as others among you had for the like apoſtaſy bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the inferiour offices of Elder and Deacon among you, and many reaſons had bene written by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon and others among you for the defence of this courſe, as I could ſhew at large by the copy of thoſe reaſons which I have by me: yet notwithſtanding even then contrary to the profeſsion of your Church, you creep in deceitfully into the office of your
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:22760:52"/>teacher, your apoſtaſy being hidden for the preſent from the eyes of your people that called you. As the deceitfull woman that hath playd the harlot before mariage and joyneth her ſelf vnto a man that ſuppoſeth her to be a virgin, doth herein gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly

                     <hi>Wheras to help mine ignorance, you propound reaſons from the book of God: had they been to the point in controverſie, I would have thanked you for ſo doing: and the rather becauſe in the former things, you preſſed me with the names of churches. But your reaſons doe not ſatisfie the queſtion, which was about</hi> Authoritie <hi>of the Elderſhip of one Church, to make or ordeine miniſters in another.

                  <p>
                     <hi>To your 1. reaſon therfore I anſwer, the help of other churches may be ſought for and vſed, if there be need, for counſel, inſtruction, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in all holy dueties. But not to doe thoſe actions which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar for every Church to doe in it ſelf: neither doe any of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which you cite prove otherweiſe. Moſes and the Apoſtles had extraordinarie callings of God, to doe things which ordinarie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may not doe. If Churches at their firſt gathering, want knowledge to do their dutie: let neighbour Churches direct them by the law of God, how to doe it: but not vſurp their power.

                     <hi>To your third: It appeareth not by Rom. 16.1. that Phaebe the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concſse of the Church at Cenchrea, ſhould execute her office in the Church at Rome: it followeth not becauſe ſhe had buſines there, and needed their aſsiſtance, that therfore ſhe went to doe the work of her miniſterie there. Neyther becauſe the Church at Corinth ſent meſſengers to cary their liberalitie to Ieruſalem. 1 Cor 16.3. doth it follow that their ordinary Deacons were their meſſengers: much leſſe that they ſhould doe their Deacons office in Ieruſalem, to gather and diſtribute the benevolence. Who would not rather think that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their gift to the Church or Officers, and left them to diſpoſe of it? And the ſame anſwer ſerveth vnto 2 Cor. 8.19.22.24. which you alledge: it proveth not thoſe meſſengers were Deacons of one Church, and did the Deacons office in an other.</hi>

I confeſse, and it is our practiſe, that the members of one Church, may receive the Lords ſupper in another, coming thither oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, yet will it not herevpon follow, that the miniſters of one church ſhould adminiſter the Sacraments, or ordeine ministers by</hi>

                     <hi>vertue of their office, in another Church. My reaſons are: The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have a peculiar relation to their particular flocks onely, Act. 20.28. Heb. 13.17. 1 Pet. 5.1.2. Apostles, and all vniverſall Miniſters, are now ceaſſed. As an huſband is no huſband but to his own wife: a Father, to none but his own children, &amp;c. ſo a ſheepherd or miniſter, to none but his own flock. But for the ſeales of the covenant the caſe is otherwiſe. For a baptiſed perſon is baptiſed not to that particular Church onely, but to all churches: and in every particular Church where he cometh, he hath all the Privileges of a Baptiſed perſon, in reſpect of his Baptiſme, and is ſo to be eſtemed of by them. Now all circumciſed perſons, had right therby</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 12.4.48. Deut. 16,1.2.</note>
                     <hi>to eat the Paſſover in any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, in the place which God ſhould chooſe to put his name there: ſo all baptiſed perſons have right to the Lords ſupper, in every true church where God hath ſet his name. But the rulers of particular ſynagogues had not the ſame authoritie in all ſynagogues, nor pastors now in all, flocks. So when a Chriſtian cometh to a flock where their Paſtor feedeth them, he joyneth himſelf to them for that time and action, &amp; is fed with them as one of Chriſts ſheep. Shew you the like warrant for Elderſhips to doe the works peculiar to their office, in other Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips or Churches: ſhew that any elderſhip may ordeine miniſters in their conſiſtories, &amp; ſend them as miniſters to other churches: (though thoſe churches, vpon trial of their gifts, be content to accept them for their miniſters,) as I have heard the practiſe is of ſome conſiſtories, vnto the Dorpes or Villages of Netherland, whoſe example you alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>

                     <hi>paſsing the bounds of their calling, as before I granted. But the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or making of miniſters, is a work of power or authoritie, Mat. 28.18.19. Heb. 5.1.4. which power is not given to one Church or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter over an other: and therfore cannot, by vertue of the common faith, be by them performed. And wheras you intimate, as if your Church intreated the miniſters of an other church, to performe it in their name, &amp;c. I have cauſe to doubt that the thing was not ſo caried: both for that I have not heard that the miniſters of the other church, (being alſo of an other language,) ever came into your publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, (according to the lawes in your firſt reaſon alleged, Exod. 29.4. Levit.
8.3.4.) to make publick prayers, and to give exhortations to your Officers and people touching their mutual duties, and ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn your miniſters: as alſo becauſe it is not their manner to ordeyn miniſters publickly in their own churches, it being by their</hi>

I have heard it alſo teſtified by ſome that have been long members both of the Dutch and French: that they never did ſee the ordination of the miniſters, though ſundry were taken into office in their time. Finally, in this your plea, how doe you diſable your own church, and the 3. other Elders that with you were authorized to feed your flock: as if there were not one amongst you, which could performe this work of ordination, or ſhew the miniſter and people their mutuall duties.</hi>

                        <p>IN anſwer to my 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> argument, you yeeld me the cauſe: for while you grant that the Prophets of one Church, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in an other and apply their doctrines, exhortations and prayers to any actions of the church where they ſpeak; you do alſo grant that the act of ordination which conſiſteth in theſe things is then performed.

                           <hi>the outward ſigne being omitted</hi> at the ordination of the miniſter among you, when you had no Elders; and ſtill you ſhew your opinion in the caſe ſpoken of that for <hi>the</hi>

                           <hi>outward ſigne onely you would not contend.</hi> 3. If the Prophets of one congregation may approve the act of an other Church in their ordination, by word in doctrine and prayers, why may they not alſo by their hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame approbation? we ſee that the
<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 13.1.2.3.</note> Prophets in the Church of Antioch, though they were no vniverſall miniſters, did yet lay hands on <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> for their confirmation in that work of miniſterie which was to be exerciſed in other places.</p>
                        <p>But for your help in this matter, you runne vnto the
<hi>Thalmud</hi> and from thence you tell me, <hi>It is holden by the Hebrewes and you think rightly, that any wiſe man might ſee the plague of Leproſie &amp; adviſe the Prieſt to pronounce it vnclean or clean, or to ſhut it vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Herevnto I anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, you give too much honour vnto theſe authors alledged when you call them <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> whereas you ſhould rather have called them Thalmudiſts, whoſe la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage is
<note n="n" place="margin">Schind. pentaglot. tit.</note> noted as a diſtincte ſpeech from the Hebrew; their ſaying is,

<note n="q" place="margin">defenc. againſt. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sm. p. 73. to 76</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning the Helleniſts) could not ſay with the Apoſtle that they were

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, what have we to do with the opinions of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous and blaſphemous Thalmudiſts, whoſe dotages and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies are innumerable? Cannot the controverſie betwixt vs be decided by the word of God, and by the voyce of the holy<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22760:59"/>ſcriptures, vnleſſe the voyce of this vnholy <hi>Thalmud</hi> be alſo called for and admitted to ſpeak betwixt vs?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, for this allegation in particular, your forgerie or miſtaking herein is very notable; for in the place of the Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud quoted by you, there is no ſuch thing to be found as you mention. There is no ſuch generall mention of <hi>any wiſe</hi> man as you ſpeak: There is not a word mentioned for <hi>the adviſing of the Prieſt to pronounce cleane or vncleane or to ſhut vp any.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie requires, that we corrupt not nor falſify the ſayings of the worſt men. He that depends vpon the Thalmud for his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhalbe fed with the winde and follow after the eaſt winde as
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Hoſ. 12.1</note> Ephraim did: But he that gives credit vnto your allegations of the Thalmud, being like vnto this, ſhalbe doubly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when as I ſearched for your allegation in the Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, in ſtead of that which you ſay, I finde in the ſame place ſuch idle and vaine traditions of the Rabbines as might juſtly ſerve to diſcredit the teſtimonies of ſuch witneſſes: as namely, their appoynting of certaine Canonicall houres whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plague of leproſy is to be ſeene:
<note n="t" place="margin">Thalmud in Negagh. c. 2. ſec.
2.</note> not in the morning, nor in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor yet at noone tide, &amp;c. alſo their traditionall rule for the poſition both of the man and womans body when their lepry is to be ſeene, viz.
<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. ſec. 4.</note> that the man muſt be ſeene as a man that holdes the plow or ſhakes the olives, meaning with the hands and feet ſpread forth, &amp;c. that the woman muſt be ſeene as one that dreſſeth or giveth ſuch to her childe, as one that weaves, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, beſide theſe and other vaine traditions, there be alſo ſuch contradictions among them even in the ſame place, as may yet further ſhew what litle credit is to be given vnto the allegations brought from ſuch diſagreeing witneſſes: as firſt vpon a Thalmudicall caſe propounded in the beginning of that
<note n="x" place="margin">Ibid. ſec. 1.</note> Chapter, concerning a ſtrong ſpot appearing as the german contract, and as the Ethiopian contract, <hi>Rabbi Iſmael</hi> expoundes it of a middle colour neither white nor black but betwixt both;<pb n="108" facs="tcp:22760:60"/>
                           <hi>R. Akiba</hi> expoundes it of divers figures appearing about the ſpot both white and black, and of middle colour, &amp;c. <hi>R. Iehudah</hi> hath yet an other expoſition, and their <hi>chacamim</hi> an other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from them all. Againe in the ſame
<note n="y" place="margin">Sec. 2.</note> place, touching the canonicall houres before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, <hi>Rabbi Meir</hi> notes them to be the third, the fourth, the fift, the ſixt, the ſeventh, the eight and the ninth houres; <hi>Rabbi Iuda</hi> notes them to be the fourth, the fift, the eight and the ninth; <hi>R. Schimeon</hi> in his gloſſe vpon the Thalmud in the ſame place notes the expoſition of <hi>R. Ioſe</hi> different from the former, namely that theſe howres were the fourth, the fift, the ninth and the tenth: and divers others ſuch like vanities &amp; contradictions might be noted out of the ſame ſhort chapter.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, for the thing that you would teach vs out of the Thalmud, &amp; firſt for any wiſe man ſeing the plague of leproſy, if you meane occaſionally as he meetes a leper, or as it is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto him, I deny it not; but if you meane that any wiſe man had authoritie to require an other to ſhew him his ſpot or plague ſuſpected, and to diſcover vnto him his nakednes whereſoever the ſpot was, eſpecially with ſuch a poſition of Body as the Thalmudiſts deſcribe, that remaines to be proved; and 2, for the adviſing of the Prieſt vpon occaſion to ſhut vp, or to pronounce clean or vnclean, I would eaſily have conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto you therein, though you had not called for witneſſe vnto this Lying Thalmud.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas you adde: <hi>yet none but the Priest himſelf might pronounce it vnclean or clean, Lev. 13.3.4. Deut. 24.8.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, this is not altogather true, for though the ſcriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged do ſhew that the Prieſts might do this thing and with more authoritie to be ſubmitted vnto, then other men ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily could do: yet do not theſe places ſhew that the Prieſt alone might pronounce a leper cleane or vncleane. For what law of God bindes a man from declaring the truth and pronouncing that to be clean or vncleane, which he certainely knowes by the word of God to be ſo? The high Prieſt and other Prieſts are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:22760:60"/>commanded to do many things which yet others might do alſo. And if the Prieſts wreſted the law, might not others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and pronounce and practiſe otherwiſe? either you muſt grant this or els you muſt in part deſtroy againe that
<note n="a" place="margin">Animad-verſ. p. 19.20.</note> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which yourſelf have made betwixt the Prieſts &amp; Miniſters, Iſrael of old and the people of Chriſt now, for remooving the leper and putting away the wicked from among them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the application of this your aſſertion vnto the queſtion in hand, you ſhew it not at all: for what though none but the Prieſt might pronounce cleane or vncleane? yourſelf confeſs and teach that the work of ordination may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſuch as are no Miniſters and ſo you practiſe: how then do you draw this argument from the ſpecial miniſteriall power of the Prieſthood vnto ſuch an action as by your doctrine might be performed without either Prieſt or miniſter.</p>

                     <div type="reason">
                        <p>MY fift reaſon was taken from the mutuall &amp; equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that is betweene miniſters and their people toga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your confeſſion that the members of one Church may lawfully vpon occaſion receive the Lords ſupper in an other Church from the miniſters thereof.

                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:22760:64"/>Secondly, as for the canons of the two Synods which you ſuborne like tvvo falſe vvitneſſes to prove your aſſertion, they are very iniuriouſly perverted and falſifyed by you. That 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> article of the Synod holden in the <hi>Haghe</hi> Anno 1586 is directly againſt you, and in expreſſe words ſheweth that the ordination of a miniſter lawfully called muſt be an <hi rend="blackletterType">opent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijcke beveſtinghe voor der Ghemeynte / </hi> that is to ſay: <hi>an open or publique confirmation of him before the Congregation:</hi> it ſhewes further how it is to be performed with convenient ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, queſtions, exhortations, prayer, &amp;c. and againe it ſhewes that this ordination muſt be done, <hi rend="blackletterType">naer het Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier daer van zijnde;</hi> that is, according to the forme which is preſcribed for that purpoſe, which ſhewes more largely in what maner it is to be performed before the Church. In the end of that article, there is an exception touching the miniſters which are to be ſent out of their countrey into the enimies land, <hi rend="blackletterType">inde Kercken onder t'Crupce / </hi> vnto the perſequuted Churches, diſperſed among the Papiſts in Colen, Antwerp, Bruſſels and ſuch like places, where they have not ſuch liberty for their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne aſſemblies: but this concernes not the Churches in their owne country. As for the Synod in Midleburgh, Anno 1581. art. 4. neither doth it impugne their maner of ordeyning miniſters publiquely in their owne Churches, but onely leaves it free: the vvords of the artickle are, <hi rend="blackletterType">het zy in de Kercke opentlijck ofte nae dat het gheleghen is inden Kercken Raet ofte Claſſe / doch altijdt met openbaere ghebeden / </hi> that is to ſay: <hi>either in the Church openly, or according as conveniency is, in the Conſiſtory or Claſsis, but alwayes with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique prayer.</hi> Beſides, this Synod at Midleburgh being holden five yeares before that of Gravenhaghe, as the date ſhewes, is to be determined according to the later Synod, and therfore doth in no ſort deny the publique maner of ordeyning mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the congregation. And further as appeares in the ſame book of their Synods, there was yet an other Synod holden at Midleburgh ten yeares after the former, agreeing vvith that of<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22760:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Haghe alſo, wherein it is agreed that the

And thus it may eaſily appeare how vnworthily you abuſe the teſtimonies of Synods, by wreſting them quite contrary to their meaning, and contrary to the truth. In the forefront of this your laſt
<note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> writing, you prefixe the ſaying of the Prophet Zacharie, <hi>Love the truth, &amp;c. Zach.
8.19.</hi> Hereby, <hi>Truth</hi> ſeemes to be as it were engraven vpon the lintell or vpper-door-poſte of your houſe, ſo that vnto thoſe which paſſe by your porch, or draw neere to enter in, your building at the firſt ſight ſeemes to be the <hi>Houſe of truth;</hi> but vnto them that enter further to view what deceitfull work is in it, your building may then quickly be diſcerned to be the <hi>Houſe of falſhood and forgerie.</hi> Fie for ſhame, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Anſworth,</hi> that you will thus write either you cannot tell what, or you care not what.

<hi>Baronius,</hi> the Popiſh champions, that they do vnconſcionably and falſly alledge many teſtimonies &amp; matters of fact, and ſo joyne falſhood with their errour; why feare you not to follow their crooked ſteps? It is great ſin for any to ſpeak vntruth in their owne name; but to make others guilty of vntruth, by perverting their teſtimonie to evill, is double iniquitie.</p>
                     <p>Yet you inſiſt ſtill, and tell vs, that you <hi>have heard it alſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, by ſome that have bene long members both of the Dutch and French: that they never did ſee the ordination of the miniſters, though ſundry were taken into office in their times.</hi> But 1. I pray you who be thoſe apocryphal witneſſes that have thus teſtifyed vnto you? If they be ſuch as dwell in this citie or in the countrie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning theſe may well bring vpon themſelves the blame of being negligent and careleſs perſons, who have no better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the practiſe of their owne Churches: eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22760:65"/>that before the ordination of their miniſters, their names are alwayes propounded vnto the congregation two or three Lords dayes before, that ſo ech member of the Church may take knowledge of that which is done. 2.

How comes it that you who have lived more then 20. yeares as a neighbour vnto the Reformed Churches in theſe countries ſhould yet be ſuch a ſtranger vnto them and ſo ignorant of their eſtate and practiſe? 3. as for the French Churches here alſo, it is their maner likewiſe to ordeyne their miniſters, Elders and Deacons in the publique congregation of the people: The deputies of their Churches were preſent at the generall Synod above mentioned holden in the <hi>Haghe</hi> Anno 1586, in the time of the earle of Leyceſter, by vvhoſe authoritye that Synod was alſo approved and confirmed: from thence they receyved the <hi>formalier</hi> of ordination before ſpoken of: and though they have not a forme printed with their Bibles as they Dutch have, yet do they keep it in writing and vſe the ſame every yeare in the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Elders and Deacons: and of their miniſters when they chooſe them, as in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of <hi>Monſieur Goulart, Morois, Baſſecourt,</hi> all which have bene publiquely confirmed in their offices before the people. And if this be not enough, I can yet bring you more plentifull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, both to help &amp; heale your incredulitie in reſpect of my eſtate, &amp; to convince your falſe aſſertion, and falſe allegations in reſpect of the Reformed Churches.</p>

Our Elders alſo and their gifts at that time were not ſo knowne and diſcerned, as ſince; they were not at that time cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen into office, neither were they ordeyned or <hi>authorized with me,</hi> (as your anſwer imports) but a good while after. 3. It had bene better alſo for your people, if they had not exalted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much as they have don, nor
<note n="p" place="margin">Pſ. 131.1.2.</note> exerciſed themſelves in things that are too hard for them: for example, your ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and buſieſt Elder <hi>Iohn Decluſe</hi> being once a member of the French church, affecting the office of the miniſterie, comes vnto the Elderſhip of that Church, and earneſtly deſires to have his gifts tryed his deſire therein is granted, he is heard divers times and allowed to make propoſitions in their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory for tryall; but in fine after tryall, he is not allowed by them (though among you he is allowed to preach and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie) they judge him vnmeete for ſo holy a work and that in divers reſpects; herevpon, and not before his diſcontentment appeares: he begins now to quarrel with the Church, and ſo in fine falles into ſchiſme, and renounces the communion of that Church and is receyved of you. How much better had it bene for him, to have kept himſelf within his meaſure, then thus to have bene diſabled by the Church of God? <hi>Every man that exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf, ſhalbe brought low.</hi>

VVhereas I gave you 3 diſtinct anſwers touching the ſame: one part thereof you do quite omit, namely my ſecond anſwer, and ſay not a word vnto that wherein you were juſtly reproved: and the reſt you do confuſedly ſhuffle togather. 2. That your ſeparation, and covenant therein ſhould be diſclaymed as a moſt abhominable thing, I have alwayes profeſſed; and you have not (as you affirme) ſhewed our agreement with England, to be more then I would pretend: Therein you ſpeak not truely 3. vvhereas you ſay of our profeſſion to ſeparate from knowne evilles, but not from the Churches of Chriſt for evilles among them, &amp;c. that <hi>they are but generalls ſuch as Arians, Anabaptiſts, (&amp; who not that profeſs Chriſt?) will make alſo;</hi> you offend divers wayes: for on the one ſide both you in your ſchiſme and many Anabaptiſts alſo will not make the like but the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion: you profeſſe that

The like profeſsion is made by Lemar the Arian, as is teſtifyed by divers: This being ſo, you did cunningly, but not honeſtly in the repetition of my words to leave out that part of them which might manifeſt this difference of our profeſsion, viz. <hi>but not from the Churches of Chriſte for evilles among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> On the other ſide there are ſome kinde of Arians, Socinians, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Anabaptiſts, Libertines, Church-Papiſts who do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſeparation from knowne evilles, but are content to hold
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:22760:67"/>communion with knowne evilles ſo deemed of them: ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely and inconſiderately you write in ech reſpect. 4, whereas you require vs to ſhew the particular evilles we ſeparate from, as you have done in your confeſsion and apology, &amp;c. you do but trifle and hold off from the queſtion; for know you not that we are one with the Dutch Church, that we are a member of their Claſsis kept in this city: that we hold the ſame fayth deſcribed in the Belgique confeſsion printed long ſince: and that we ſubmit vnto the ſame order of governement with them? Doth it not hereby appeare vnto you, what particular evilles we ſeparate from? And what need we then to print any new confeſſions as you have done? If you obiect any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in matters of leſs moment, you know them to be ſuch, as that you approve vs therein, rather then them.

That which you ſay of the worſhip, miniſtery and Church eſtate in England ſo many yeares convinced, &amp;c is but a falſe boaſting and flattring of your ſelf in vaine: I have before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated vnto you divers treatiſes wherein your errours about theſe matters are refuted. 6. You do notoriouſly pervert my words, when you ſpeak of my <hi>diſclayming but in compariſon, as do the Dutch and French Churches: as if the arme of fleſh could not fayle me, or be faultie in approving that which is to be condemned:</hi> vpon theſe your words the reader which had not ſeene what I wrote, might be made to beleeve, that I had alledged the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe Reformed Churches as an argument to juſtify our eſtate: but it is far otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhewed their practiſe to be the ſame with ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely to this end: that it might appeare how inexcuſably partiall you are that condemne vs as a falſe church, for that very thing which thoſe whom you do confeſſe to be true Churches, do hold as well as we. My words were plaine and I deſire the reader to mark them, and with all to judge how<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22760:68"/>well you cleare your ſelf of that partiality imputed: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my words have not bene vvrongfully vvreſted by you. 7. VVhere you ſay, my compariſon is vnfit, for that <hi>we were in our perſons, members of that Church and vnder the Prelates rule,</hi> &amp;c. I anſvvere, ſundry people of our Church vvere never members of the Church of England, but came out of Scotland and from other places. Many members of the Dutch Church, have in their perſons bene members of the Church of England and vnder the prelates rule: yea ſome of them have bene miniſters vnto Engliſh congregations and vnder the prelates. Many yea and the greateſt part of our Church at the firſt gathering vvere ſuch as in their perſons were then members of the Dutch Church, and were from them tranſlated vnto vs with teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their ſound faith and godly converſation. Many that in their perſons were never members of the church of England may be as much and more guilty in approving the corruptions of that Church, then ſuch as have there lived vnder the rule of the prelates. How vaine then is that which you except againſt my compariſon?</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, you bring ſome colour of an argument againſt the lawfulnes of our communion: but it is far too light to prove vs a falſe Church.

<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> before, to prove that the reaſons directed againſt the Church of England, are againſt ours alſo: you ſay, vnto vs, <hi>The remooving of our dwelling into an other land, remooveth not your ſins from you, nor you from them: it is your repentance onely and faith in Chriſte, that can purge away your ſins, Luk
13.3.5. Mark. 1.15 Papiſts that dwell here, in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or other where belong to the church of Rome, till they break off themſelves by repentance. Neither doth the abſteyning from the practiſe cleare the ſinner: for the guilt of Cayns Murder, cleaved vnto him all his dayes, becauſe he was not cleanſed by repentance and faith, although he never killed man more,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not our ſin in communion with, but your ſin in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the church of England that is to be repented of. As you are refuted and called vnto repentance by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> for one mayne part thereof, vvhile he hath convinced your more private ſchiſme: ſo are you by ſundry others for your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique ſchiſme. VVhen your ſeparation from our particular congregation hath bene vvell examined, I doubt not but your ſeparation from England alſo vvill thereby appeare in a great meaſure to be vnvvarrantable: and then the vvay being ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, my reſolution is (the Lord aſſiſting) if need be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further vvith you in ſhevving your ſchiſme from

                  <p n="2">2. If our communion vvith the Church of England vvere a ſin, yet is it not knowne ſo to vs; vve aſſure our ſelves of the contrary: all your obiections we judge to be vnſound. VVe repent vs of our knowne ſins: our ſecret ſinnes we know to be innumerable, and we endevour to be humbled for them: and beleeve that in Chriſt they are done away; So that if our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with England were a ſin, yet are we not tyed in the cords thereof, as you teach. Nay your doctrine as it is applyed and maynteyned againſt vs, to the contrary, is a manifeſt and a maine hereſie, overthrowing the Goſpell, and the foundation of Chriſtian Religion both concerning faith and repentance in vs, and concerning the Merit of Chriſtes death &amp; obedience. Vpon your reaſoning it followeth; that no Repentance and faith is accepted vnto ſatvation vnleſs there be a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of all ſins diſputed againſt, as you have done againſt vs; that the Blood of Chriſte doth not cleanſe vs from al ſin: but that we are ſtill tyed in the cordes thereof, vntil there be a particular diſcerning and acknowledging of the ſame.

                  <p n="6">6. This your reaſoning ſerves to bring confuſion and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation vpon your owne particular Church: for it is manifeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne profeſsion that there are many knowne ſins among you vnrepented off and to omit a multitude of others which I could name, conſider but theſe: It is well knowne that ſome of your people do heare ſermons in Idol-temples as you call them, and though you plead againſt me, that this is a heynous ſin, yet you do now ſuffer it practiſed among you. Your Elder <hi>Iohn Decluſe</hi> alledged this among the reſt for one cauſe of his ſeparating from the french church, viz. <hi>becauſe they ſuffred the party innocent to reteyne the offendant that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery &amp; to live ſtill togather:</hi> &amp; heretofore (as you

For there might be ſome manner and meanes then vſed, which I ſay not that Magiſtrates are now bound vnto: as that all ſuch malefactors as were then to be ſtoned, muſt be ſtoned now, and may dye no other death. There were lawes in Iſrael, to cut off murderers, adulterers, and other flagitious: yet ſome things perteyning to murder and adulterie, were peculiar to that land and people, as cities of refuge, Num. 35. the expiation of murder when the Author was not knowen, Deut.
21. And ſo for the manner of puniſhing adulterie, by ſtoning, Ioh. 8.5. by burning, Lev. 21 9. or other wayes. Now I ſuppoſe you hold, that murderers and adulterers are by vertue of Gods law at this day to dye: &amp; yet you wil not affirme that they muſt dye onely after that manner that was in Iſrael.

                        <hi>To your inſtance from Deut. 13 I anſwer, that it followeth not if an other law be all or any part of it abrogated, therfore this alſo in Deut. 12. is ſo likeweiſe: as the law for a murderer to dye, is not now aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed becauſe of that law in Deut. 21. Secondly, you ſhew no reaſon why that law in Deut. 13. ſhould not now ſtand in force: the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience which you object of thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thouſands of people at this day, vnder that iudgement, is but a ſuppoſition.

As it is preſumption to affirme that which you cannot prove, ſo is it vaine and idle, to inſiſt vpon that which is at firſt yeelded vnto you. 4, though I think (as you hope) <hi>that Chriſt inſtituted no ſuch Nunnes, Nunries or Chappelles for them,</hi> &amp;c. yet let vs not make them worſe then they are: It is ſin to

Againe, for ſeparation from mariage, this kinde of Nunnes, whoſe chappel we have, were not ſo bad as other ſorts of them. This order of Nunnes, being called <hi>Bagines</hi> were not bound by vow vnto ſingle life, as other orders of them were:

                        <p n="2">2.

Shevv a difference from the plaine vvords of the lavv as you ſpeak, if you can. As for the common expoſition of the Hebrewes, whereof you alſo ſpeak, they are contrary to the law of God and not worthy to be mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Your third reply is, <hi>if any ceaſsing of that law be at this day vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it cannot in equity be for the Idolaters themſelves, or any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Idolatry, but onely for their civill goods, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>

                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:22760:75"/>1. If that law be ceaſſed for civill goods, then for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and temples likevviſe which are the civill goods of men; even as the Chappel which we vſe is a part of the Magiſtrates civil goods, and by them lent vnto vs. The vſe which vve have of them in Gods vvorſhip hinders not but that they are our civil goods: even our Bibles though vve have a religious vſe of them both in publique and in private worſhip of God, are yet a part of our civill goods alſo. Your meeting houſe ſerving for your religious exerciſes in publique, is it not a part of your civil goods? Vnleſs you did vſe this plea before the Magiſtrates in your ſuites about the ſame, I think you vvould not long enioy the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If this law ceaſſe onely in reſpect of civill goods, then vvhat ſhall become of infants and other litle Children, the

                        <p>Your fourth reply is: <hi>if the iudiciall law againſt Idols and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters be abrogated: then alſo againſt blaſphemers, murderers, &amp;c. which is the opinion of the Anabaptists, who would take the ſword from the Chriſtian Magiſtrates, &amp;c.</hi> I anſvver.</p>

Pa.</note> IN ſetting downe my third anſwer: you do in the firſt place very deceitfully and vniuſtly repeat the ſame: for whereas I according to the queſtion betwixt vs, noted that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>for deſtroying idolatrous places</hi> vvas expreſſely determined and reſtreyned to the Land of Canaan, to the Idolles of thoſe nations, &amp;c. in ſtead of this, (the commandement in Deut. 12. being both againſt Idolatrous places, and the Idols themſelves) firſt you omit and leave out that mention of <hi>Idolatrous places</hi> wherevpon I inſiſted in particular, you ſpeak generally of the
<hi>Commandement in Deut. 12.</hi> and afterwards turne it in ſome of your anſwers vnto the <hi>Idolles</hi> themſelves, <hi>as if God would not</hi>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:22760:83"/>
                        <hi>have other Idoles destroyed,</hi> contrary vnto my words and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: as the reader may ſee in my
<note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> former writing. There is a great difference betwixt theſe two ſentences: <hi>The commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Deut. 12. is reſtreyned to the deſtruction off the Idolles of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which I ſayd not: and this, <hi>The commandement for deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying Idolatrous places is reſtreyned to the Idolles of thoſe nations, &amp;c.</hi> which was my anſwer.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you bring 5. reaſons to prove that there was no ſuch reſtreynt, &amp;c. And firſt, you labour to manifeſt it,
<hi>by an other like law in Levit. 18.3. where they were forbidden to do after the maner of Egypt wherein they dwelt, &amp; of Canaan whither they ſhould come, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though God have forbidden men to imitate the maner &amp; workes of the Egyptians &amp; other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in their Idolatrous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and other abhominable practiſes, as well as the Idolatries of Canaan: yet doth it not follow hence, that he hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vſe of the places in all alike. The law <hi>in Lev. 18.3.</hi> is not in this particular poynt of <hi>the place</hi> like vnto that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. This you ſhould have manifeſted, if you could.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If vſing the place of falſe worſhippers be
<hi>a doing after their maner,</hi> then are you guilty of following the maner of the Iewes ſeing ſince your ſeparation from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon, you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had your ordinary publique meetings for the worſhip of God, in the ſame place where they have alſo ordinarily and publiquely exerciſed their abhominable Idolatries and falſe worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond reaſon is taken from <hi>other like words in that very law, Deut.</hi> 12.2. <hi>all the places wherein the Nations which ye ſhall poſſeſs, &amp;c. and the execution of this law in deſtroying the places of Idolatrous Iſraelites, as Ieroboams temples, &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. Seing even by your owne confeſſion and words, <hi>the limitation is as wel in reſpect of the</hi> Nations <hi>as of the</hi> Land; all reaſon requires, when any commandement is deſcribed in divers words, whereof ſome are more full and ample then others, that then the limitation ſhould be vnderſtood according to thoſe phraſes that are of<pb n="154" facs="tcp:22760:84"/>greateſt extent: and conſequently the commandement for the
<hi>Land</hi> of Canaan, conteyning not onely the particular places vvhere the Canaanitiſh nations, but alſo the places where the Idolatrous Iſraelites did worſhip their Idols, might ſerve for a warrant vnto <hi>Ioſias</hi> to deſtroy Ieroboams temples being within the Land of Canaan, 2.
<hi>Kin.</hi> 23. But what is this to vs that are without the, <hi>Land of Canaan?</hi> The fulleſt and ampleſt phraſe in that commandement Deut.
12. doth not extend vnto the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we reteyne in the worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>Your third reaſon is, <hi>becauſe not the idols of Canaan onely, but of all other nations are Divilles, Deut. 32.17. 1 Cor. 10.20. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alike abhorred of God and to be deſtroyed as abhominable to men.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though Idolles be called Devilles, yet doth it not follow from thence, that the places where they have bene formerly ſerved, may not be converted vnto the vſe of Chriſtians to worſhip God in the ſame: you bring ſcriptures to prove the antecedent of this reaſon, which you needed not: but for profe of the conſequent you bring nothing, which you ſhould have done: if you would have made your reaſon good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. VVe know that Devilles are of
<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 17.21. &amp; 12.45.</note> ſundry kindes and ſome wicked Spirits are worſe then others: as alſo are the Idolles and the different ſervices of them; and therfore we cannot ſay that they are <hi>alike abhorred</hi> of God; or that the places where they have bene ſerved are in like manner to be deſtroyed of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that all Devilles, Idolles and the ſervices of them were in themſelves &amp; in their owne nature equally evill; yet as the circumſtance of the place doth often aggravate the ſin, ſo God having taken and appropriated the Land of Canaan vnto himſelf to be
<note n="p" place="margin">Levit. 25.23.24.</note> 
                        <hi>his Land</hi> in a peculiar manner, how can you ſay but that the pollution of this holy Land by Idolatrie, might in this regard deſerve a greater deteſtation of all the monuments, inſtruments and meanes of ſuch pollution?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. VVe ſee in
<note n="q" place="margin">Mark. 16 9. Luk. 8.2.3</note>
                        <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> that the very ſame breaſt which was firſt a real poſſeſſion of wicked Spirits, a cage of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane<pb n="155" facs="tcp:22760:84"/>birds, and an habitation of Devilles, was afterwards ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed to be an holy temple and habitation of God by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: If the glorious and bleſſed God refuſe not to be worſhipped and dwell in ſuch a Den of Devilles after it is once purged, why ſhould we in this reſpect of former pollution (having no other ſpeciall reſtraint) refuſe to worſhip God in ſuch an habitation of idolles, when as the Idolatrie is remooved, and the place pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed from the former vncleannes of the Devill?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the worſhip of Devilles make places ſo polluted that no cleanſing will make them fit for the publique ſervice of God, then is that place of your aſſembly vnlawful, where you have taught the doctrine of Devilles; ſeing
<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 15.9</note> their doctrines are part of their worſhip, even as the doctrines of God are a part of Gods worſhip and ſervice. In
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Anſ. to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iacob. p. 135, 140
147.</note> your writings againſt the Church of England, to prove that they are <hi>departers from the faith, no true Chriſtians, holding fundamentall errours, teaching the doctrines of Devilles:</hi> you alledge that <hi>that Church forbiddeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, &amp;c.</hi> namely, <hi>vnto fellowes of colledges, prentiſes, and to all men and women in Lent, Advent, Rogation week, &amp;c.</hi> If this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption dravv ſuch a heavy Burden vpon the back of England, then vvill it bring as heavy a Doome vpon your ovvne heads, vvho teach the Doctrine of devilles by forbidding Mariage in a far vvorſe maner then the Church of England doth, viz. by forbidding your people, all both men and vvomen, to mary vvith the godly members of the Reformed Churches, &amp; this not for any terme of yeares, at any ſet time, but at all times: yea excommunicating ſuch of your people as have ſo maryed with the members of the Dutch Church, ſetting downe this mariage as one cauſe of your giving them to Satan: And in the cordes of this ſin you are ſtill holden, wanting repentance for your evill: for this doctrine of Devilles, which is a part of their worſhip, according to your owne reaſoning, the very place where you have ſo worſhipped is to be deſtroyed, and can never be cleanſed vnto a lawfull vſe in the worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>Your fourth reaſon is, <hi>becauſe long after the deſtruction of the</hi>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:22760:85"/>
                        <hi>Idoles of Canaan, God teacheth his people the like deteſtation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all Idols in generall, Eſa. 30.22. Ier. 10.11. &amp; 51.17.18. Zach. 13.2. Ezek.
30.13.</hi> Anſwer. You do here run quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the queſtion: from the Idolatrous places to the Idolles themſelves. And of all the ſcriptures that you here produce, there is not one of them that ſpeakes a word, touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch places, as have bene abuſed to Idolatry but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Idols themſelves or of other vnneceſſary appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances belonging vnto them. VVhen you ſhew by any juſt conſequence of argument, how they ſpeak for you: you ſhall then (godwilling) receyve further anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Your fift reaſon is, that <hi>the Prophet ſpeaking of Egyptians, ſayth not onely that God would break their images, but that he alſo would burne the</hi> houſes of their Gods <hi>with fyre, Ier 43.13. wherfore the law extendeth not to the Idolies of Canaan onely, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Here indeed is ſpeech, not onely of the images, but alſo of their houſes deſtroyed: and this you note ſo plainely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, that I wonder how you could not obſerve it, in your former reaſon, vnleſſe you did willingly winke and purpoſely turne away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2, there is yet in this ſpeech no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or rule to binde vs to deale in like maner with all other places abuſed to Idolatry: The deſtruction here noted is a judgement of God executed by
<note n="t" place="margin">Ier. 43.10</note> Nebuchadnezzar an Idolater himſelf, that had no conſcience or regard of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Deut. 12. vvho did alſo by the like judgement of God burne the
<note n="u" place="margin">Ier. 52.13.</note> 
                        <hi>temple</hi> at Ieruſalem, and not onely the houſe of the Lord, but alſo the <hi>Kings howſe, and all the howſes</hi> of Ieruſalem: So that by ſuch reaſonings as this, from the judgements of God by heathens, you might as well conclude the deſtroying and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of private mens houſes for their Idolatry: of palaces and judgements halles: and of Gods owne howſe ſo oft as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by Idoles.</p>
                     <p>That which I ſayd for illuſtration of this poynt, in reſpect of greater ſeverity ſhewed vnto the Idolatours of Canaan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their owne perſons, as vvel as in their Idoll-places, is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:22760:85"/>ſo plaine, that in ſtead of refuting the ſame, you go about to confirme the ſame by bringing reaſons thereof from the
<hi>fullnes of their ſin:</hi> and becauſe they were the <hi>Children of the curſe more then other.</hi> And yet there is a further and higher cauſe thereof, even the hid counſell of God, and the good pleaſure of his will: for others alſo as the Iewes came to
<note n="vv" place="margin">Mat. 23.32-36. with 1. Theſſ. 2.15.16.</note> fullnes of ſin, and became the
<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 11.21.22.</note> Children of curſe, more then other for their contempt of the Goſpell: yea more then the Canaanites themſelves; for the
<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 10.15.</note> Sidonians were Canaanites: yet was there no warrant for any therevpon to ſhew ſo great ſeverity againſt their perſons. That which you repeat touching the difference betwixt idols and idols, devils and devils: as alſo touching the deſtruction of the temples of Egypt is already anſwered.</p>

Now how theſe abominable places, ſhould be by the blood of Chriſt, or by the word &amp; prayer ſanctified to be places for Gods people to worſhip him in; appeareth not by Pſal. 24. compared with
1 Cor. 10. but rather the contrary. For thoſe meats offred to idols, which might be eaten ſold in</hi>

                        <hi>the ſhambles, or at an infidels private table, might not be eaten in the idols temple: although ſuch as did eat them there, knew that the idol was nothing, and thought it therfore in their Chriſtian tibertie to ſit at table there, 1. Cor. 8.4.10. and
10.19.—22. Neyther am I of your minde, that the meats offred to idols, are as much polluted as the idol or idol temple: for (if we may by the Apoſtles</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, where you ſay <hi>it doth not appeare by pſ.

<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> heires with Chriſte of the earth, then may ech place of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſerve vs for a place to worſhip the Lord in. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the earth for our vſe being indefinite, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the largeſt ſenſe for our comfort, while no reſtraint is<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22760:88"/>added. They that vnwarrantably reſtreyne this gift vnto a civil vſe onely, they rob both Chriſte and his Servants of a great part of their inheritance. 2, vvhereas you inſiſt, that theſe meates ſacrificed to jdols <hi>might not be eaten in the Idols-temple:</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks according to the preſent eſtate of thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, while jdolatry vvas ſtill exerciſed in them; vvhile thoſe Idol-feaſts were kept, vvhich vvere a part of their
<note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.7 21</note> falſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip performed vnto the Idols: but vvhat is this to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſe of theſe places purged from Idolatry and imployed in the true vvorſhip of God?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, vnto your comparative reaſon to prove Idol-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vvorſe then Idol-ſacrifices, becauſe they pollute the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and not the ſacrifices them; as on the contrary the temple ſanctifyed the gold, &amp;c. I anſvver. 1, your compariſon is vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and vnlike; for the ſanctification of the oblations and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices depended vpon one temple and Altar therein: there being no other place to ſanctify their offrings: but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of theſe meates ſacrificed to Idols did not depend vpon any one temple or Altar:
<note n="l" place="margin">Hoſ. 12.11.</note> their altars vvere many I as heapes in the furrovves of the field: therfore a different povver for conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration is to be obſerved. Neither is it true vvhich you ſay that the Idol-ſacrifices did not pollute the places: though the holy ſacrifices could not ſo much ſanctify the altar of the Lord as the altar them Mat. 23. yet might the Idols ſacrifice as much pollute, the Idol-places, as the places them: becauſe in vncleane things there is often a
<note n="m" place="margin">Hag. 2.13.14.</note> ſtronger working to pollute, then there is in holy things to ſanctify. Yet further, that men be not deceyved in the miſvnderſtanding of Chriſts words,
<hi>Mat. 23.17.19.</hi> it is alſo to be conſidered how God would that
<note n="n" place="margin">Levit. 16 20. Numb. 7.10.88. 1 Kin.
8.63. 2 Chron. 29.21.24.</note> both altar and temple ſhould be ſanctifyed by the offrings, 2, ſuppoſe it were as you ſay, that Idol-places were worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Idol-ſacrifices: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mark into what evilles you caſt your ſelf: Then the places where we worſhip are worſe then the Idol-ſacrifice of the Maſſe, worſe then the ſacrificing of a childe vnto Moloch: and communion in the true worſhip in one of<pb n="163" facs="tcp:22760:88"/>theſe temples is worſe then communion with the Maſſe or any of thoſe abhominable ſacrificers offred out of the Idol-temples appoynted therevnto: Then how is your apoſtaſy aggravated hereby, when after your ſeparation, you yeelded to worſhip God in one of theſe polluted places, committing a more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſin then if you had yeelded to heare the Maſſe, or to communicate in any heatheniſh Idolothyte out of the Idol-temple? Then how great is your ſin ſtill, which tolerate among you an Idolater, that dayly worſhippeth God in one of theſe temples? by this kinde of reaſoning, you might as well allow the members of your ſeparate company to heare Maſſe, or to participate with other abhominable Idolatries: Thus do you daſh your feet againſt the ſtones, which you caſt in our way: &amp; cruſh your ſelf in peeces, with your owne reaſons returning vpon your head.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, you ſay, that in <hi>Deut. 12. which is the ſcripture in hand, you finde no ſuch Commandement to deſtroy meates or other things offred to Idols, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. If I finde it for you in other places of ſcripture, though not in that, yet have you no cauſe to accuſe me, for ſpeaking, where the law is ſilent. 2, even the analogie of that place Deut. 12. ſhewes their deſtruction: for if there can be no further vncleannes and pollution ſhewed in the places there appoynted to be deſtroyed, then there is in the Idol-ſacrifices: then doth the equity of that law require that like things ſhould be alike deſtroyed. 3, vve ſee more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely in other places of ſcripture that things dedicate or give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Idols were to be deſtroyed: as the
<note n="o" place="margin">2 Kin. 23 11.</note>
                        <hi>horſes</hi> conſecrate to the Sun which <hi>Ioſias</hi> aboliſhed: and the <hi>Charets of the Sunne,</hi> which he burnt with fire. 4, even your ſelf in this ſection confeſſe abſtinence from things offred to Idolles to be a ſhadow or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, &amp;c. If they muſt be abſteyned from and not eaten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were they deſtroyed; whether burnt with fire, or given to the Dog, or othervviſe deſtroyed, it ſkilleth not. How then do you forget yourſelf? 5, afterwards againe in the next chapter you plainely argue that heathniſh temples were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,<pb n="164" facs="tcp:22760:89"/>becauſe they were <hi>part of their Religion and Idolatries:</hi> which you prove, becauſe <hi>Cicero</hi> calles them <hi>holy and religious:</hi> Now I hope you will not deny but that Idolothytes or Idol-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were alſo a part of their religion and Idolatrie, that the heathens accounted theſe ſacrifices <hi>holy and religious,</hi> as well as their temples: and therfore it followes moſt plainely by your owne reaſoning, that they were to be deſtroyed as well as their temples. Thus you ſee there is no cauſe to complayne of me for ſpeaking, where yourſelf are not ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, you adde, that <hi>it was not lawfull (by 1 Cor.
10.) to vſe things for that wherevnto Idolaters had in ſpeciall manner conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated them, &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. 1. It is ſhewed before from pſ.
24. with 1 Cor. 10. that we may have not onely a civill but alſo a religious vſe of ſuch things notwithſtanding any ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. 2, though
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay, that their temples were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for prayer, for the word and Sacraments; yet doth it not follow that we vſe them for the ſame things; becauſe our prayers, preaching of the word &amp; Sacraments are not the ſame with theirs; their prayers being Idolatrous invocations of creatures: their ſcriptures, apocryphal: their preachings, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical; their Sacrament of Euchariſt, an horrible Idol, &amp;c. For theſe things they vvere conſecrated ſome of them: but for theſe ends we vſe them not.</p>

                        <hi>what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? and (of the Church he ſayth) what agreement hath the temple of God, with idols? So the type of one place, helpeth you nothing. No more will the taking away of the difference of place; which you laſt inſiſt vpon. For our ſaviours words (in Ioh. 4) ought in reaſon to be expounded according to his Fathers law, not againſt it, even by his own doctrine, Mat. 5.17. So that when idols and idolies are destroyed as God commanded, and the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſanctitie of Ieruſalem is ended: then are all places free to worſhip God in, in ſpirit and trueth.

I ſayd not, that the commandement for one place of ſacrifice, was the <hi>onely cauſe</hi> why Idol-places ſhould be deſtroyed; your denyall thereof is idle and beſide the matter; and tends to deceive your reader, in making him to think that I had affirmed the ſame. 2, that the commandement of a peculiar ſet place of ſacrifice was one cauſe it may appeare by the coherence of the text and by the oppoſition betwixt the actions ſpecifyed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. for whereas the deſtruction of the Idolatrous places is commanded <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.3.4. the vſing of one place alone which God ſhould chooſe to put his name there, is alſo immediately taught &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted<pb n="169" facs="tcp:22760:91"/>in the ſame place, and in the
<hi>verſ.</hi> 5. next following 3, as for their being <hi>devils houſes,</hi> which you alledge as the cauſe of their deſtruction, that is without warrant, as hath bene ſhewed before: and may further appeare by this: becauſe then every private Idolaters howſe, yea and every obſtinate ſinners houſe ſhould be deſtroyed, and be vnlawfull for vſe, ſeing all ſuch perſons are called
<note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 6.70. &amp; 8.44. Act.
13.10.</note> devilles and Children of the devill and therfore their howſes, devilles howſes. 4, thoſe two places of ſcripture <hi>Exod. 23.24. Deut.
7.25.26.</hi> are in a double regard miſalledged by you, for firſt they ſpeak not a word for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of Idolatrous places, which is the queſtion: but onely of the Idols themſelves; and ſecondly, if they did ſpeak of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the places, yet doth it not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appeare, that it ſhould be vpon this ground, becauſe they are devilles howſes, which is the poynt, that in this place remaines to be proved of you. 5, As for Iaakobs practiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.2.3.4. there is nothing ſayd tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the deſtruction of any place defiled by Idolatrie, but of other things of leſſe neceſſary vſe, of which more is to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereafter, where that ſcripture is againe alledged by you. And what meane you to tell vs of Moſes deſtroying the Idol, or golde Calfe <hi>Exo.</hi> 32.20. as though there were no difference betwixt an Idol and the place where it ſtood? How often do you turne away from the queſtion of <hi>the place,</hi> to an other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion touching images themſelves? 6. As for the deſtruction of Idols and Idol-temples <hi>in other lands alſo as Egypt, Moab, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, &amp;c. where no one place was choſen for ſacrifice:</hi> touching that which was done in Egypt, <hi>Ier. 43.12.13, and Ezek. 30.13.</hi> you have bene anſwered already in the third ſection going before: And yet further you may obſerve this, that if the fact of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar in deſtroying Idolatrous countries and houſes may thus be alledged as a rule to be followed of neceſſitie, you may as well plead that the houſes of other ſinners are to be deſtroyed and not to be dwelt in, becauſe of his and other princes decrees to
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Dan. 3.29 Ezra, 6.11.</note> pluck downe and deface them for blaſphemy, hindring the building of temple, &amp;c. Then ought you not to have vſed that<pb n="170" facs="tcp:22760:92"/>place which the blaſphemous Iewes had once poſſeſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited before you. Touching Moab &amp; Babylon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.7.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50,2. The prophet ſayth nothing there touching the places themſelves, but onely for the Idols <hi>Chemoſh, Bel, Merodach:</hi> of which our queſtion is not. And in ſumme touching all theſe nations togather, though no one place was choſen in them for ſacrifice; yet ſeing one place was choſen then in Ieruſalem for all the godly in the world to ſacrifice in, and no other allowed for ſacrifice in any of theſe nations: even in this reſpect alſo the vſe of ſuch places, were double vnlawfull at that time, once for their ſacrifices, and againe for their Idol-ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Your third reply is, that <hi>if we look vpon the thing figured by that one place, it will lead vs from theſe Idol-temples now, rather then to them, &amp;c.</hi> But I anſwer, though Chriſt and his Church were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the temple of old: though Chriſt have no concord with Belial, nor his Church any agreement with Idols, as you alledge from 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15.16. yet what is this to the vſe of thoſe temples from whence Belial and the Idols are caſt out? Though a Legion of devilles have dwelt in any living temple or other place, yet when they are caſt out and diſpoſſeſſed, cannot Chriſt enter in and dwell there, vnleſs he hold a concord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them? That no agreement is to be had with Belial and Idols, we graunt willingly, but that the worſhip of God in the places whence they are caſt out is an agreement with them, we deny: for proofe of this, which is the poynt, you have ſayd nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you reply divers things alſo touching
<hi>the difference of place which is now taken away</hi> Iohn. 4.21. You ſay,
<hi>Seing Chriſt, to bring in the true ſpirituall worſhip, would not onely end, but even</hi>

                        <hi>deſtroy the citie and the ſanctuarie, how can we think, that he would have the idolie of the Samaritans stand vndeſtroyed; or the abominations that his enimie Antichriſt ſhould afterwards erect?</hi> I anſwer, 1. For that place,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel</hi> there ſhew that the ſanctuary ſhould be deſtroyed, yet doth he not ſhew that it was vnlawfull for Chriſtians after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<pb n="171" facs="tcp:22760:92"/>to have met togather for the ſpirituall worſhip of God in the ſame place: And therfore that kinde of deſtruction is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, being nothing like vnto that which you plead for, even to the remooving of the lawfull publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, for ever out of the place defiled by Idol-ſervice. 2, as
<hi>Gabriel</hi> foretels the deſtruction of the ſanctuary, ſo in the very ſame verſe he foretelles the ſlaughter of the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> both theſe were to be done by the providence of God, according to the determinate counſell of his will; neither of them according to his law by any warrant of his word, but both of them by the authoritie of the cruell and wicked Romanes, which both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the temple and ſlew Chriſte: Their fact in deſtroying the temple was abominable, even
<note n="t" place="margin">Dan. 9.27 with Mat. 24.15. &amp; Luk. 21.20.</note> the <hi>abomination of deſolation:</hi> ſo that if you have no better arguments for throwing downe our temples, then this example; your deſtruction of them ſhall be but an abhominable deſolation, without any warrant of Gods word. 3, The Angel in this place doth ſhew the vvill of God as well for the deſtruction of the citie it ſelf as of the ſanctuary: ſo that for ought in this place, you might as well have collected and concluded the deſtruction of Idolatrous cities and the private houſes of Idolaters, as the deſtruction of the temples abuſed vnto Idolatrie.</p>
                     <p>But for the confirmation of your opinion, you plead fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that text <hi>Ioh. 4.21.</hi> and ſay, <hi>Firſt, it ſheweth that God ſhalbe worſhiped, neither in the mount of Samaria (where they committed Idolatry) nor in Ieruſalem, (where the typical worſhip had bene for a time.) wherevpon it followeth, that Antichriſt having erected temples for Idols, in imitation of Ieruſalems temple purpoſely in the parts and ſhape as the Papiſts acknowledge, &amp;c. we are rather to conclude that God is not to be worſhiped in them.</hi> I anſwer, 1. The denyall of worſhip in the mount of Samaria and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, is not abſolute, but the meaning is that men ſhould not be tyed to thoſe places; and therfore Chriſt oppoſeth not any other locall place vnto thoſe two, but onely oppoſeth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip in ſpirit and truth, which might be now in any<pb n="172" facs="tcp:22760:93"/>

                        <note n="u" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> places without exception. 2, Though our temples had bene made liker vnto the temple in Ieruſalem then they are: yet doth it not folow that it is vnlawfull to worſhip God in them: for proofe of this conſequence you bring nothing: And as for the conſecration of them and your teſtimony of Bellarmine, they are to be examined in the next Chapter, where you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate the ſame at large.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you plead from <hi>Ioh. 4.23.24.</hi> that
<hi>Chriſt there tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all men to worſhip God in ſpirit &amp; truth: which are oppoſed both to figurative worſhip and falſe worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, though Antichriſts temples in his vſe of them are a part of his falſe worſhip: yet doth not that pollute vs in our vſe of our owne temples, being quite contrary vnto his. The Iewes temple wherein you worſhipped God after them, was in their vſe of it a part of their falſe worſhip, (as is anone more fully to be manifeſted,) was your vſe of it therfore condemned by <hi>Ioh. 4?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you plead, that <hi>we cannot in reaſon think, that there ſhould be more indifferencie of place novv, then there is of other things, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt things of neceſſary vſe and other trifles: A place for the worſhip of God is of neceſſary vſe: and thoſe which we have are of great conveniency for vs, being civil helpes in the ſervice of God: &amp; therfore we vſe them with good conſcience, ſeing all things are pure vnto the pure, <hi>Tit.
1.15.</hi> But as for cope, mitre, ſurplice, and ſuch like we do juſtly refuſe and reiect them, being vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions that are of no neceſſary vſe at all in the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>VVhereas you ſay further, that <hi>according to my manner of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Idolies, the Corinthians (vvhom Paul convinced of ſin for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the idolie, by an argument of Iſraels practiſe) might alſo have pleaded, that thoſe things concerned Iſrael vvhich vvere a ſpecial people, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that you compare things together very groſly: for Paul convinced the Corinthians of ſin for eating in the Idol-houſe with the Idolaters, at that time and place when
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:22760:93"/>they did inſtantly committ Idolatrie, thoſe Idol-feaſts being a part of their worſhip, as hath bene ſhewed before from <hi>1 Cor. 10.7.21.</hi> but you in vaine ſeek to convince vs of ſin for the lawfull worſhip of God in thoſe places from whence the Idols and Idolatry are remooved: Now I pray you, what proportion or ſimilitude is there betwixt theſe two things: viz. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the true worſhip of God with the faithfull in a place purged from Idolatrie; which is our caſe: &amp; Communion in an Idol-feaſt an Idolatrous worſhip, this with heathniſh Infidelles, even in the place where the Idolles ſtood, and were preſently worſhipped; which was the caſe of the Corinthians? Let him that readeth judge, whether the Corinthians could make the like plea for themſelves that we do.</p>
                     <p>Finally as for your comparing of our defence vnto the plea of ſome Papiſts in expounding the ſecond commandement itſelf to be
<hi>a temporall precept,</hi> which opinion of <hi>Catharinus</hi> even Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine himſelf refuted in the place alledged by you: I anſwer, that any lew might as lawfully tell you the ſame, and ſay vnto you, <hi>even as you hold and plead for the abrogating of the ſacrifices and ceremonies of the law: ſo ſome Papiſts have alſo pleaded against the ſecond commandement itſelf, that it was a temporall precept:</hi> If his compariſon ſhould be vniuſt againſt you: ſo is yours againſt vs.</p>

                     <hi>the Archdeacon is to ſignifie to clergie and people, that they faſt before it be conſecrated, and ſo must the Biſhop do that conſecrateth it. And the evening before, the Biſhop prepareth the reliques which are to be incloſed in the Altar, putting them in a veſſel, with three graines of frankincenſe, and a writing on parchment ſignifying whoſe reliques are there incloſed, and to whoſe honour and name, the Church and Altar is dedicated, &amp;c. In the morning, they make ready holy chriſme, holy oile, two pound of frankincenſe, a cenſer, aſhes, ſalt, wine, an hyſſop ſprinkle, five litle croſſes for the Altar, two veſsels of holy water: and they paint twelve croſses on the wall.

Then they ſing, this is Gods houſe, firmly builded, well founded on the firm rock: this is no other but the houſe of God, and gate of heaven. They pray God to infuſe his grace on that houſe of prayer, that the help of his mercie may be felt of all that there call on his name: that his eyes may be open to that houſe day &amp; night: that he would favourably admit every man that comes to adore him in that place: that there the Preiſts may offer ſacrifices of praiſe, the people may pay their vowes: that in that houſe by the grace of Gods ſpirit, the ſick may be healed, the blind cured, Lepers clenſed, Divils caſt out, and the bonds of all ſynns vnlooſed. Then call they the ſaincts of God to enter into the citie of the Lord, for a new Church is builded for them, where the people ought to adore Gods Majeſtie. Then the Biſhop makes a ſhort Sermon to the people, of the vertue and privileges of the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the church, of Tithes, and other eccleſiaſtical fruits to be payd &amp;c. and ſo the founder and people promiſe to fulfyll the Biſhops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to prove that our temples are a part of his abominations, you do further vrge both the ſcriptures, and popiſh writings: And
<hi>firſt</hi> you ſay, <hi>the text, Rev. 18.11.12. mentioneth the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the vvhore, vvhich no man ſhould buy; naming Gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, &amp;c.</hi> And you <hi>hope I vnderſtand not theſe things of merchandiſe properly, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Suppoſe this merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is not to be vnderſtood properly, muſt our temples ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs be a part thereof? you have not yet brought ſo much as a colour of any proofe for this, out of the ſcriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. 2, That
<hi>Gold and ſilver,</hi> and ſuch like things even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken are the merchandiſe of Rome, as well as other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, it appeareth evidently, by the infinite treaſures &amp; ſummes of money which that Church hath extorted from the nations of the earth, and divided the ſpoyles thereof among her merchants: even by your owne teſtimony out of
<hi>Mantuan,</hi> the <hi>crownes</hi> and diademes of princes were ſold at Rome vnto ſuch as would buy. All ſtories ſhew, that even civill principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Kingdomes, Empires were bought and ſold at Roome: the pope ſetting on the Emperours crowne with his feete, and with his foote againe daſhing it from the head. 3, vvhat though there be <hi>an alluſion vnto the Prophets through out the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and in this place alſo to the merchandiſe of Tyre,</hi> as you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? This hinders not but that many things in ſuch alluſions may be vnderſtood properly. The Angel that proclaimes the deſtruction of Roome,
<note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 18.2. with Eſa. 21.9. Ier.

The Lord in his judging of Antichriſte will have even

                  <p>In the next place, after ſtreyning of the ſcriptures, you come vnto the popiſh vvritinges and promiſe <hi>to bring me vnto the Popes owne Ware-houſe,</hi> &amp;c. I anſvver.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, though you take vpon you to be our guide to leade vs into the Romane Pontifical and other ſhops of the Pope, yet am I &amp; other to take heed hovv vve follovv ſuch a guide, vvhen before our eyes vve ſee you to ſtumble at the firſt ſtep, and to break your ſhinnes even at the very threſhold of th ſhop you enter into.

                     <hi>decree of Pope Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas, it is not lawfull for any man to build a Church or Temple, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commandement or leave of the Pope and Apoſtolik ſea:</hi> you do herein falſify the vvords of the decretal, vvhich doth not ſpeak of <hi>building</hi> a Church without the Popes leave, but of <hi>inſtituting</hi> a church. And this appeares more plainely by the Popiſh <hi>Gloſſe</hi> vpon the next Chapter in the ſame
<hi>diſtinction,</hi> which ſaith
<note n="d" place="margin">De conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. diſt. 1. part. 4. c. Nemo.</note> 
                     <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto is ſhewed by whoſe authoritie Churches are to be conſecrated, but now by whoſe authoritie they are to be built.</hi> VVhereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that the Author of the Gloſſe interprets the decree of pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> not of <hi>building</hi> as you alledge, but of the
<hi>inſtitution</hi> of Churches, according to the words of the decree: Theſe two things are plainely diſtinguiſhed in that place. But as before you dealt vntruely with the
<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 107.</note> Thalmudique canons, and with the
<note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 117.</note> canons of the Synods in the Reformed Churches, ſo do you here deale with the popiſh canons. VVhat vncleane fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have you thus to defile and corrupt the ſeverall teſtimonies which you meddle withal?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what weight or authoritie is there in the Popiſh records of theſe vncertaine and variable decrees? They were ſo often changed and altered, that vpon the credit of them, you cannot ſay of our temples, that they were conſecrated by ſuch<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22760:97"/>authoritie as is therein appoynted. This vncertainety and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riablenes of the decrees, as it might be ſhewed by many other inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ſo doth it alſo appeare moſt plainely eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching this poynt of conſecrating churches &amp; this alſo in the tractate alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your ſelf: for whereas the text of the decretal ſaith
<note n="g" place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat. diſt. 1. par. 3. Cap. De locorum.</note> 
                     <hi>Church is to be conſecrated without the authoritie of the pope:</hi> The Gloſſe vpon the ſame place ſaith concerning that decree, <hi>Hodie non tenet:</hi> This decree was then altered: And the explication of this matter is further deſcribed in the ſame place. And thus we ſee that the authoritie of the pope was not neceſſary, either for building or yet for conſecrating of our temples. Theſe things were in the power of the Biſhop, as well as of the pope: and therfore it is alſo written in their law:
<note n="h" place="margin">Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. Iohan. 22. tit. 5. in Gloſſa.</note> 
                     <hi>The Biſhops can do as much as the Pope in thoſe things which are of the efficacy of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as there is this difference in the decrees touching the authority by whom, ſo much more in the divers rites and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes vſed in the maner of conſecration of temples: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of rites is confeſſed by themſelves: ſaying,
<note n="i" place="margin">Durand. rational. in praefat.</note>
                     <hi>It ought to be conſidered that in the divine ſervice there is found a variety of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold rites: for almoſt every Church hath their peculiar obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. Therfore let not the minde of the reader be moved: if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily he read in this work ſuch things, as he doth not know to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his owne Church: or if he do not finde, whatſoever is there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi> In this regard you cannot ſay of our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples with any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that thoſe peculiar rites and cuſtomes mentioned by you in this place, were obſerved in the conſecration of them. In ancient time, temples were conſecrated
<note n="k" place="margin">Hoſpinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Templ. p. 105.</note>
                     <hi>onely by prayer;</hi> and being once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated in ſuch manner, they were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated againe with theſe rites, even by the teſtimony of the Popiſh
<note n="l" place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat. diſt. 1. part. 7. c. eccleſijs.</note> decrees themſelves. Therfore all that you have ſayd touching theſe rites, is a mere vncertainty, eſpecially touching ſuch
<hi>Oratories</hi> as this place is wherein our particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth meet togather for the worſhip of God: This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they ſhew betwixt oratories and other Churches, viz. that
<note n="m" place="margin">Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitan. de conſecrat. Eccl. C. p. Auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> 
                     <hi>an Oratorie is not conſecrated, neither hath a dowrie appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:22760:98"/>
                     <hi>neither is made principally that</hi> Maſſe <hi>ſhould be celebrated</hi> therein, <hi>but for prayer, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly touching the frame and Fabrick of theſe temples
<hi>builded</hi> (as you alledge out of Bellarmine) <hi>after the forme of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons temple, with three parts and the most holy towards the eaſt, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering therein from the Iewes temple for a myſterie, &amp;c.</hi> Herein alſo there is great difference of temples; neither do you ſo faithfully relate the teſtimony of Bellarmine touching this matter as was meet: for he ſpeakes not indefinitely of them as you do, but with ſuch words as imply an exception: vvhen he ſaith of their 3. parts,
<note n="n" place="margin">Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. de cult. ſanct. lib. 3. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>ferè omnes, almoſt all</hi> are ſo built: and of their looking to the eaſt, he ſaith it is <hi>vt plurimum,</hi> for the moſt part implying that ſome are otherwiſe: And his fellow-cardinall acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that ſome Churches, as
<note n="o" place="margin">Caeſ. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Eccleſ. Tom.
5. p. 140.</note> that of Gaza by <hi>Eudoxias</hi> meanes made in forme of a Croſſe, were built otherwiſe: differing mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely therein from the forme of Solomons temple. And for the temples of this city they are of divers ſhapes: no one fully like vnto an other: for our temple in particular, it hath not thoſe 3. parts whereby it ſhould reſemble Solomons temple, wanting both <hi>porch,</hi> &amp; <hi>chancel:</hi> ſo that your reaſoning here againſt vs in reſpect of the forme and ſhape of temples (as you did alſo in the former Chapter) is as vaine as any things els.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, as for that which you ſpeak of the <hi>holynes, myſteries,</hi> or myſticall ſignifications aſcribed vnto temples and vnto the rites of their conſecration by Bellarmine, Durandus, and others: they are many of them more different and vncertaine then the rites themſelves: <hi>Durandus</hi> himſelf in the
<note n="p" place="margin">Rational. divin. offic. in praefat.</note> beginning of his book confeſſeth touching the popiſh rites, that <hi>there are divers ſenſes</hi> or ſignifications <hi>given vnto the ſame thing, and they paſſe from one meaning to an other:</hi> And the
<note n="q" place="margin">Ioann Aloyſius. ad Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Tiraſ.</note> popes auditour in an Epiſtle prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the end of the ſame book affirmes that many prieſts, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Arch-Biſhops for innumerable yeares had conſecrated, and obſerved their rites and ceremonyes being altogather ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what they did: And that <hi>now onely &amp; not before</hi> they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſame by <hi>Durandus</hi> his explication of thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.<pb n="183" facs="tcp:22760:98"/>Hereby it appeareth that the myſticall ſignifications of holynes aſcribed vnto temples and other ceremonies were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinions invented at length by ſome ſpeciall men, not knowne vnto many of the learnedeſt among the Papiſts, and therfore not obſerved generally as parts of their worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, ſuppoſe that our temples had bene conſecrated ech of them, even in the manner above mentioned by you, yet doth it not follow that they are a part of Antichriſts abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as you would faine have the rites of their conſecration to ſpeak for you. Though in their Idolatrous vſe of them for falſe worſhip, and with vaine confidence in them, they were vnto the Papiſts a part of their abhomination, yet not ſo vnto vs, that reiect thoſe ſuperſtitions and vſe them lawfully in the true worſhip of God: Even as <hi>Golias</hi> his ſword though an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cruelty and murder ſerving for the maintenance of heathniſh Idolatry in the hand of the Giant, was yet
<note n="r" place="margin">1. Sam. 17.51. &amp; cap. 21.9.</note> lawfully vſed by David as an inſtrument of juſtice to the glory God: yea though happily that ſword were conſecrated with magicall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, according to the maner of the heathen which vſed enchanted armour and weapons. When you conclude from the Chriſtians merchandiſe <hi>Eſai.
55.1. Rev. 3.18,</hi> that <hi>theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ordinances and Idolatries are Antichriſts wares,</hi> you conclude beſide the queſtion: Thoſe popiſh ordinances and Idolatries are in our aſſemblies dayly confuted, condemned and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the word and ſpirit of Chriſte as <hi>2 Theſ. 2.8.</hi> and the authority of the Magiſtrate hath <hi>made the whore naked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate</hi> in taking away theſe temples from her and converting them to the true worſhip of God, according to <hi>Rev. 17.16.</hi> though they be not deſtroyed as Baals houſe was according to the policie of Moſes which is now abrogate; That which you ſhewed before to the contrary is already anſwered. Though Solomons temple to the Iewes, and the heathniſh temples vnto <hi>Cicero, Antiochus, the Epheſians,</hi> and other heathens in their vſe of them were circumſtances and inſtruments of their religion (for you do vnfitly call them parts of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) <pb n="184" facs="tcp:22760:99"/>yet the proportion thereof reacheth no further, then to ſhew that popiſh temples were vnto the papiſts inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their religion in their vſe of them: but that our temples in our vſe of them are ſo, you cannot ſhew from hence. That which you alledge of the heathens ſin from
<hi>pſ. 79.</hi> in deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying the temple is Idle, for it was alſo a ſyn of the heathen to deſtroy the private houſes of the Iewes. That which you ſay of the Corinthian Idol-houſes hath bene anſwered before. The teſtimony of <hi>Mantuan</hi> for ſelling of temples at Roome, is againſt yourſelf, and ſhewes that our temples are not the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes merchandiſe, becauſe he cannot <hi>for the maintenance of his kitchin</hi> ſell the ſame according to the meaning of <hi>Mantuan:</hi> The pope ſhould have but a leane kitchin, if he had no greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues then the proffit which he now gets by the ſale of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. That allegation of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.18. is abuſed by you, for the Prophet there ſpeakes of the whole city &amp; Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Tyrus to be deſtroyed for their ſins: and you might from thence as well conclude the deſtruction of Kings palaces and the private houſes of wicked Merchants for their falſe barganies, and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent dealings as of Idol temples, for their ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if for the ſuperſtitious rites of conſecration, our temples ought to be deſtroyed and aboliſhed, then how comes it that the churchyardes are not lyable to the ſame judgements, ſeing they have bene alſo conſecrated by Biſhops in like maner with ſuch abhominable rites and Idolatrious ſuperſtitions, as the temples were? How can you according to your maner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the churchyard; in the buriall of the dead, and yet deny vs the church, when as the pollution of their conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alike for both? your owne

It will not be ſufficient for you to ſay, that your vſe of theſe Churchyards is onely a civill vſe, otherwiſe then our vſe of the temples: for that commandement in <hi>Deut.
12.1.2.3.</hi> doth as well condemne the reteyning of ſuch places for civil vſe, as otherwiſe. That commandement is ſo expounded by <hi>H. Barow,</hi> not onely for the times before Chriſte, but alſo for our time when he ſaith of our temples:
<note n="x" place="margin">Diſcov. p. 138.</note> 
                     <hi>Againe the Idolatrous ſhape ſo cleaveth to every ſtone, as it by no meanes can be ſevered from them whiles there is a ſtone left ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtone. So that neither they can be vſed to the worſhip of God, nor we have any civil uſe of them, ſeing they are execrable and devote to deſtruction: ſo that they that vſe ſuch execrable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane things, cannot be cleane, but must needes be defiled with the filthines of theſe Idols.</hi> By his verdict therfore you muſt needes be defiled even with the civil vſe of theſe execrable things. And not onely Barow but your ſelf alſo do condemne the reteyning of theſe places for civil vſe: in that you hold they are to be throwne downe &amp; demoliſhed by the Magiſtrates ſword: for if it were lawfull for the Magiſtrates to convert theſe places vnto civil vſes, as vnto judgements halles, courts or the like, what needed they to be throwne downe or burnt with fire, as you teach in this place? Yea even in this Chapter you teach that they are to be <hi>dealt with as was Baals houſe,</hi> which was throwen downe by Iehu, and
<note n="y" place="margin">2. Kin. 10 27.</note> a jakes made of it. If theſe places in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of former abuſe are ſtill to be reputed ſo baſe and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, what meane you to deale ſo vnnaturally with the bodies of your frendes as to bury them in theſe Idol-places, places of ſo great diſhonour: yea to execute vpon them the
<note n="z" place="margin">Lev. 26.30.</note> curſe that is denounced againſt ſuch as the ſoule of the Lord abhorres, even <hi>to caſt their carkeiſes vpon the bodies of theſe filthy Idols,</hi> as you call them? The calamity which you bring vpon your frends is (according to your owne profeſſion) much like vnto that which Ioſias inflicted vpon the Idolaters: he
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Kin. 23 16.</note> tooke their dead bones out of the graves and conſumed them with fire vpon the Altars polluted with Idoltary: you take the dead<pb n="187" facs="tcp:22760:100"/>bones of your frends and bring them to be conſumed in thoſe graves which are in the Temples and Churchyards pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Idolatry.

                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, if our temples formerly defiled with Idolatry, and ſuperſtitious rites of conſecration are therfore of neceſſity to be aboliſhed, forſaken and new ones to be ſought: then will it alſo follow that popiſh baptiſme being in like maner defiled with Idolatrous rites, ought by the like neceſſity to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, forſaken and a new Baptiſme to be ſought. And while you reteyne among you the Baptiſme adminiſtred in popery, you can not without partiality refuſe our temples. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this conſequence, you may obſerve, 1. The pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of baptiſme by ſo many ſuperſtitious ceremonies of croſſing, exorciſing or adiuration of Devilles, exſufflation, ſalt, ſpitle, oyle, &amp;c. is as great as the pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of temples by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration: yea if there be any difference, rather baptiſme is more polluted, as may appeare both by your
<note n="e" place="margin">Animad. verſ. p. 68.69.72.73.</note> owne writings, and<pb n="188" facs="tcp:22760:101"/>might further be manifeſted out of the Romane pontifical, miſſal, decretales and other popiſh writings, if need were: 2. As Baptiſme is neceſſary and ordeyned of God, ſo is an howſe or place of worſhip for the faithful to aſſemble
<note n="f" place="margin">Eſa. 4.5. 1 Cor. 5.4.</note> in, neceſſary &amp; appoynted of God. If therfore the generall commandement of Baptiſing do warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs to reteyne even that ſame particular baptiſme which was ſo ſuperſtitiouſly adminiſtred at the firſt, then likewiſe will the generall commandement of having a place to aſſemble in, warrant vs to reteyne even the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place that was ſo ſuperſtitiouſly conſecrated at the firſt. 3, if the perſons vnlawfully circumciſed and baptiſed in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous and falſe Churches, might yet through faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance come to a lawfull &amp; comfortable vſe of their former circumciſion and baptiſme, as your ſelf do
<note n="g" place="margin">Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. p. 69. 70.</note> acknowledge: then why can not our repentance and faith as well ſanctify vnto vs the places ſuperſtitiouſly conſecrated, while we do in like maner diſclaime and renounce the ſuperſtitions of ech of theſe? 4. your doctrine touching the reteyning of baptiſme doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto vs that diſtinction, which ſerves for anſwer vnto your maine obiection againſt our reteyning of temples: H. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſayth
<note n="h" place="margin">Diſcov. p. 119.</note>
                     <hi>Peradventure herevpon may be collected that ſuch bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as is delivered by an infidel, which never had knowledge of God in Chriſt, being afterward repented of and ſorrowed, that their body hath bene guilty of ſuch profanation, &amp;c, the outward Baptiſme may in like maner remaine, and not be repeted when they ioyne vnto the true Church. This may at no hand be brought to paſſe, neither indeed doth it herehence follow: for eaſy it is to put difference betwixt an Infidel which never knew God in Chriſt: and an Apoſtata which hath had knowledg of, and ſtill outwardly (though corruptly) profeſſeth God and Chriſt. The one ſort know not what the Church, worſhip and Sacraments meane: the other (though corrupted in their knowledge) yet cary a ſhew of Church, worſhip, Sacraments, miniſtery; yea &amp; hath them though corrupt and adulterate: ſo there is neither ſequele nor compariſon betwixt them.</hi> According to this diſtinction may we anſwer your reaſon from <hi>Deut. 12.</hi> and other like ſcriptures
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22760:101"/>touching the aboliſhing of temples defiled with Idolatry: viz. that it is eaſy to put difference betwixt heathniſh Infidels ſuch as the Cananites were that never knew God in Chriſt: and the Apoſtate Church of Rome, which ſtill outwardly (though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly) profeſſeth God and Chriſte, &amp;c. And therfore there is no ſequel nor compariſon, that the temples erected by Papiſts ſhould be aboliſhed, becauſe the heathniſh temples of pagans and infidels were to be deſtroyed. Though in other places you will not admit of this diſtinction but cavill againſt it, yet this doctrine of Barow (which you
<note n="h" place="margin">Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. p. 70.</note> alſo ſend vs vnto) doth here plainely confirme the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, if the ſuperſtitious conſecration of places vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry do neceſſarily inferre the deſtruction of the ſame, then are private houſes and many other implements alſo of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be deſtroyed: becauſe they alſo are often hallowed with many ſuperſtitious rites, &amp;c. you labour here to prove that <hi>the temples of the gentiles were a part of their religion and Idolatrie,</hi> by the teſtimony of
<note n="i" place="margin">Cicero Act. 6. in verr.</note>
                     <hi>Cicero,</hi> which calleth their temples <hi>holy and religious:</hi> and herevpon inferre that ſuch places ought to be deſtroyed. If this kinde of arguing be ſound, then will it alſo follow by the teſtimony of the ſame oratour that private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are in like maner to be deſtroyed, as being a part of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters religion: for he ſaith of private houſes,

                  <p>Tenthly, if temples and houſes defiled with ſuperſtitious conſecrations are to be deſtroyed, as being the Popes merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; then will it alſo follow that the living temples and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the infants in their popiſh baptiſme, and popiſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their ſuperſtitious ordinations and popiſh princes in their coronations being as much defiled with Idolatrous rites, as our temples, are in like maner to be deſtroyed, and leaſt of all to be vſed in the worſhip of God. As for the meaſure of pollution, it were eaſy to make as large a narration and ſtory of ſuperſtitious ceremonies and diviliſh inchantments vſed in the hallowing of theſe infants, prieſts and Princes, as you have made touching the conſecration of temples: but I take it to be needleſs: the matter is plaine out of the

But if there be any ſuperſtitious perſons that put more holynes in them then they ought, though ſuch in a large ſenſe and metaphorically may be called Idolaters, and be ſayd to make Idols of them, yet this ſin of theirs is not enough to prove that they ought to be aboliſhed: even as the covetous perſons that put their truſt in their riches, and labours and ſay vnto the wedge of Gold, Thow art my hope; may iuſtly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <p>That which you ſay of the Corinthians eating in the Idols temple, <hi>1. Cor. 8. &amp; 10. chap.</hi> that they <hi>by ſuch a pretext as I make, might have pleaded for their ſin, &amp;c.</hi> is far otherwiſe: Had they vſed the Idol-temple onely to the lawfull worſhip of God, after all exerciſe of Idolatry had bene baniſhed out of the ſame, then ſhould not the gentiles errour in conſecrating it before, have polluted them: And this is our plea, for our vſe of temples at this time. But what could this excuſe the Corinthians commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with the Infidels &amp; Idolatours, in the very act of their preſent falſe worſhip, in their Idol-feaſts and ſacrifices, while their Idolatrous exerciſes were ſtill in full force with them? VVhat a huge diſtance is there betwixt theſe two caſes? VVhat Spirit of diſcerning have you, that can not or will not put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt communion with Papiſts, in the maſſe, in eating of their breaden God, in their Idol temple, which is like the practiſe of the Corinthes; and betwixt communion with true Chriſtians, in true worſhip, in the place purged from Idols and falſe worſhip, which is our practiſe?</p>
                  <p>VVhereas you obiect further, that my <hi>anſwer ſerveth as well for wearing a miter, a cope, &amp;c. And that I do indeed hereby nouriſh the errour of their conſecrating, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. the miter, cope, ſurplice and ſuch like never had nor can have a neceſſary vſe in the ſervice of God, nor be any civil helpes in the ſame, vnto ſuch as have other clothes to put on their backes: but a place &amp; houſe to meet in for the ſervice of God is a neceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that cannot be miſſed as hath bene ſhewed before: ſo that there being ſuch difference betwixt theſe two things, if ſimple people or Papiſts be offended at that, which is of ſuch<pb n="197" facs="tcp:22760:105"/>vſe, their offence is vpon their owne heads onely. 2, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo that ſimple people by your vſe of the Churchyards are occaſioned to eſteeme them holy places ſtill: The Papiſts may with like reaſon that they vſed in their ſupplication to the King boaſt that their Religion hath given and conſecrated the Churchyards as well as the Churches: And your practiſe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in theſe places, being that end wherevnto they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated of Papiſts, is as much an occaſion of offence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto them; doth as much harden them in their errour: and is as much againſt that Commandement
<hi>1 Cor. 10.32.33.</hi> as is our vſe of the Churches or temples: and if you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your practiſe by the neceſſary vſe which you have of them, you will ly vnder that guilt which you would ſo faine lay vpon vs: where neceſſity excuſeth not, the guilt of offences and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles doth come vpon men as wel by civil as religious actions. And further according to your obiection, conſider that if the Papiſt can get their conſecrated Churchyards, now vſed by you, into their hands againe (as they have already done in ſome townes of theſe countries) you ſhall plainely ſee that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their conſecration continueth with them: and even now whiles you do bury your dead in them, they are viſited and prayed in by Papiſts, as holy conſecrated places, &amp;c. And if any difference be, they are like to be offended rather at the buriall in the Churchyards and Churches, then at the worſhipping in them, in as much as they are more ſuperſtitious about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall then other ſervices, holding it more lawfull to pray and ſerve God in other places, then to bury in other places. Thus you may ſee, that if there be any force in this your reaſoning, it is all againſt yourſelf.</p>

                  <p>But let vs further examine, whether now vpon the ſecond whetting, and putting of more ſtrength to it, your blunt Axe have got a ſharper edge to hew downe our temples.

                  <p>Againe, as if your compariſon were an argument with two edges, you ſay that you alſo <hi>compare things thus; As the deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying of Gods temple tended to his diſhonour pſ. 79, &amp;c. ſo the raſing of Antichriſts temples would be to his diſhonour, &amp;c.</hi> The ſequele of this argument for the neceſſity of plucking downe our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22760:107"/>I denyed, becauſe there is a change of the law,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. This you call <hi>no anſwer,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer you againe more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely and fully, 1. Though God would have Antichriſte to be diſhonoured: and though the raſing of his temples would in ſome regard be a diſhonour vnto him: yet are not we bound vnto all meanes, nor yet vnto this particular meanes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſhonouring him by deſtruction of his temples: even as God would have Idolaters to be diſhonoured, and the
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 13.15.16.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of their goods and cartell, their city and their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be to their diſhonour: yet doth it not follow, that we are now bound vnto this meanes and maner of diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, as hath bene ſhevved before, becauſe there is a change of the law.

<note n="k" place="margin">Dan. 3.29.</note> plucking downe of their houſes, vvould be to their diſhonour: yet doth it not follovv that vve are novv bound vnto this particular maner of diſhonouring them. 2. VVhereas you do alledge three Chapters at randon and at large, viz. <hi>2 Theſ 2. Rev. 13. and 18.</hi> to ſhevv that God vvould have Antichriſt diſhonoured; and not honoured, &amp;c. you do but beat the ayre in vaine, vnleſs you could have inferred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that <hi>our not honouring</hi> of him could not ſtand vvithout plucking dovvne his temples. 3.

                     <hi>to Magiſtrats, nor taken ought from them; but left them as they were authorized of his Father. Eyther then they are vnder Moſes policie, (I mean, ſo as to execute the Iudgements taught of God by Moſes) or elſe they are under none; but may judge and puniſh as they themſelves think good, killing ſuch as God by Moſes law would not have to dye, and ſparing ſuch as he appointed to death.

As for Iewiſh rudiments, your temples are a ſynful reviving of them, after they were dead by Christ. The things appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God for his figuratiue worſhip, might not be imitated by men for any vſe, as the Law in Exod. 30.32.33. teacheth vs: and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes from thence rightly concluded,</hi>

According to your doctrine Princes (though ſubiect in other things) yet might reſerve one knee of Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall authoritie, which they need not bow vnto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas for a reaſon of your former denyall, you alledge that <hi>Princes have their authoritie from God, who is the head of Chriſt.</hi> This hinders not but that they may have it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, who by his Fathers
<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 11.27. Ioh. 3.35.</note> graunt hath all things given into his hand; and therfore even by authority receyved from his Father might change and abrogate ſome of the judiciall lawes given by Moſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: when you ſay further touching the authority of Princes, <hi>If they had it from Christ, there could be no lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:22760:109"/>
                     <hi>but Christians ſo Pauls doctrine to be ſubiect to Caeſar, ſhould be overthrowne:</hi> This is alſo vnſound: for though there be no Magiſtrates but Chriſtians, which can lawfully reteyne and vſe their authoritie; yet doth it not follow that ſubiection vnto all other Magiſtrates is vnlawfull: It is with Magiſtrates and their dominion and authority as it is with other men in all their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and heritages: whoſoever is not in Chriſt is an vſurper and vnlawfull poſſeſſour of whatſoever he hath, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any right or title that they may have therevnto by the providence of God in reſpect of humane lawes: becauſe Chriſt is

And even ſo every Magiſtrate that is not in Chriſt, is but an vſurper &amp; an vnlawful poſſeſſour of whatſoever dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or authority he exerciſeth, notwithſtanding any right or calling that he hath therevnto in reſpect of men: yet is this no warrant vnto the ſubiects of ſuch Infidel-Magiſtrates, to with draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their ſubiection, or to deny obedience and tribute vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to that you ſay, <hi>Christ hath neither given power to Magiſtrates, nor taken ought from them; but left them as they were authorized of his Father, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. for the kindes of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them ſelves, that were authorized of God before Chriſt, it was

                     <hi>Daniel,</hi> and others were civil Magiſtrates in <hi>Perſia and Babylon,</hi> they could not adminiſter juſtice according to the policie of Moſes, but according to the lawes of thoſe Kingdomes where they lived.

<hi>Mordecai &amp; Daniel</hi> have take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe offices and callings vpon them with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: ſo that hereby it may appeare that there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe lawes, eſpecially in theſe times. 5, yea even in the holy land it ſelf, when as the Iudiciall lawes of the
<note n="c" place="margin">Neh. 10.3.7.</note>
                     <hi>Perſians</hi> &amp;

                     <hi>Romanes,</hi> were eſtabliſhed among the Iewes, who were then ſubiect vnto theſe nations and vnto their officers, yet did the godly Iewes live vnder them and ſubmit vnto their authority, which they could not have done in ſuffring them ſelves to be guided by their civil lawes, if the Iudicialls of Moſes had bene impoſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by the Lord, as preciſely and ſtraitly as were the morall and ceremoniall lawes. 6, it is yet a further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, when as you ſay, that <hi>Chriſt gave Magistrates no directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom and how to puniſh, otherwiſe then he gave with God his Father at Mount Sinai.</hi> For Chriſt with God his Father gave further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection how to
<note n="e" place="margin">Num. 15 32.34.</note> puniſh the Sabath-breaker, after that they had departed from Mount Sinai. And afterwards againe at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law in the land of Moab, there was further directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> given touching

                  <p>As for the vſe of the words, <hi>policy,</hi> &amp;
<hi>rudiments,</hi> which I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one after an other, you make a falſe collection from thence: though I name both, it followes not that I hold both to be of like extent: neither do I reſtreyne the policy of Moſes vnto his rudiments: but my ſpeech argues that ſome part of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy conſiſts in ceremonies and rudiments; ſuch as the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of places defiled with Idolatry in ſuch maner as I have manifeſted before from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. againſt your perverting of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>After this you labour to prove that <hi>our Temples are a ſynfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of Iewiſh rudiments, after they were dead by Chriſt:</hi> your firſt allegation is, that <hi>the things appoynted of God for his figurative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, might not be imitated by men for any vſe, as the law in Exod 30.32.33. teacheth vs.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, 1. this is a bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make the yoke of the legall ceremonies heavyer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant: for though the holy oyntment and perfume might not be imitated by men for any vſe, doth it follow hence that other things appoynted for the figurative worſhip were in like manner forbidden? for example, we reade of ſundry kindes of meat offrings, and among the reſt of ſome
<note n="g" place="margin">Levit. 2.4.5.7. &amp;c.</note> baked, ſome fryed, and ſome made in the caldron, and all for the figurative worſhip of God: how can you ever prove that theſe kindes of meates thus prepared, which might fitly ſerve for the ordinary vſe of man, were forbidden to be imitated? 2, ſuppoſe that before Chriſt theſe kinde of meates had bene forbidden, yet are you far wide to apply ſuch a prohibition vnto our time, and to deny vnto vs ſuch preparations of meate as were then vſed in the figurative worſhip of God: yourſelf rather are herein
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:22760:112"/>guilty of <hi>a ſynfull reviviving of Iewiſh rudiments</hi> by impoſing vpon vs the ceremoniall prohibitions and ordinances, which are
<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 4.3. Eph. 2.14.15. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7.1. &amp;c</note> dead by Chriſt. Yea you would make our burden heavyer then the Iewes, by laying ſuch a yoke of ceremonies on our neckes, as you can not ſhew that God ever layd vpon them. 3, ſuppoſe, that the oyntments, perfumes, meates and temples appoynted for the figurative worſhip of God in old time, might not be imitated by men <hi>for any vſe</hi> as you ſay, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we offended alſo by imitating the forme of the Iewiſh temple, as you would have it: then are you and your people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably guilty of the ſame ſin with vs, while you vſe theſe our temples for divers vſes; you for your ſtudy: divers of your people for receyving of almes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. Thus are you caught and entangled in the ſnare which you layd for vs: for you are to remember that the holy oyntment whereof you ſpeak, was
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 30.32.33.</note> forbidden vnto men not onely in the worſhip of God (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then is there expreſſed,) but for any vſe whatſoever: as yourſelf alſo confeſſe: And therfore that ceremonial precept if it be ſtill in force, according to your vrging of the ſame, doth as well condemne your vſe of theſe temples, as ours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the countenancing and confirming of your obiection, you content not yourſelf with holy ſcriptures, but you lead vs from <hi>Moſes ben Amran</hi> vnto <hi>Moſes ben Maimon,</hi> from faithfull <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of Chriſt vnto the Infidel
<hi>Moſes</hi> a profeſſed adverſary of Chriſt, and out of his ſcripture you tell vs, ſpeaking of holy oyntment, that <hi>the Hebrewes from thence rightly concluded, It is vnlawfull for a man to make an houſe after the patterne of the temple.</hi> I anſwer, 1.

2, there is yet more colour and excuſe for the Rabbines in this their errour conſidering their eſtate, then there is for you: for they ſuppoſing that the leviticall and ceremoniall ordinances are ſtill in force do more colourably hold that the holy things of God may not be applyed vnto or imitated in common vſe, but you knowing the ceremonies to be aboliſhed, have leſſe reaſon ſo to vvrite as you have done.</p>

If our Temples be vnlawfull becauſe they are made after the patterne of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Temple, then doth this concluſion of the Rabbines as wel condemne you in the vſe of theſe Temples as it doth vs, for that which you ſay the Hebrues have rightly concluded is ſpoken of any private civill houſes whatſoever made for civil vſe, ſuch they hold to be vnlawfull for any vſe being made after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the Temple: And ſo al that you have ſayd both from the Scripture &amp; from <hi>Maimony</hi> is againſt your ſelf, conſidering the divers vſes which you have of theſe Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, as I ſhewed before.</p>

                        <hi>Repl. To your exception about Moſes temporarie diſpenſation, I have ſpoken before. This which you now adde, of no neceſsarie vſe, may in ſome ſenſe be granted: for in deed Chriſtians haue no neceſsary vſe of Antichriſts idols or idol Temples, let them therfore periſh with him; as they ſhal,</hi>

But if by</hi> Neceſſarie, <hi>you mean in reſpect of humane pleaſure or profit, as the Lutherans may think they have a neceſsary vſe of popiſh images (which they keep in their Churches) either to adorne their Temples, (which may alſo be pleaded for by Pſal.

                        <hi>may weare the popes hallowed golden crucifixes and other ſacred Iewels for broches on their hatts, &amp; tablets about their necks, and his beads, for ornaments about their hands. The images of their Ladie, and other gods &amp; goddeſſes, they may vſe to bewtify their houſes, yea to adorne the wals and corners of their Churches, as they ſtil continew in the Church win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. The altar may be vſed for a communion table, the hallowed font, for a veſſel to baptiſe in, as is vſual in Engl. though theſe reformed Churches haue doen it away. The Biſhops think they haue as neceſſary vſe of their copes &amp; other hallowed veſtiments, as you of your Temples, which many of them by reaſon of their bignes and forme, are fitter a great deale to ſing a maſſe in, then to preach the goſpel. So it wil come to paſse, that all the popes abominations ſhalbe reteined for ſome vſe or other, and idolatrie nouriſhed to the diſhonour of God. If we ſhould expound all the other commandments, as you interpret this concerning idolatrie: God might iustly condemne us as corrupters of his Law, and ſeducers of the people. But let us weigh your perticular exceptions.</hi>

Do you not ſee how you curſe yourſelf in praying for the deſtruction of theſe Temples which you and your people frequent ſo often for divers purpoſes? For what if God ſhould heare your prayer, and while your ſelf are ſitting at your ſtudy in one of theſe Temples, ſhould ſuddenly rayſe a tempeſt and overthrow the temple? ſhould not your blood be now vpon your owne head that had called for this iudgement? dare you enter into and continue in ſuch a place, againſt which you pray dayly that God would deſtroy it? or are you content to periſh your ſelf, ſo that one of theſe Temples might periſh with you?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whereas by way of prophecy or prognoſticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you foretell the periſhing of theſe Temples, &amp; ſay; <hi>as they ſhall, in the time of their viſitation.</hi> I anſwer, 1. that place
<hi>Ier.</hi> 10.15. which you alledge for confirmation of your prophecy, ſpeaketh not of Temples but of Idols, and therfore concludeth nothing againſt the place vſed by vs. 2. If the deſtruction of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh and heathniſh Temples had bene there prophecyed of and foretold, as is in other places the deſtruction even of the private houſes of the Babylonians; yet doth not this ſhew that the like event ſhalbe vnto all places where Antichriſtian Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath bene practiſed: for both in reſpect of equitie, there is great difference betwixt Babyloniſh Temples not purged from their Idolatrous vſe; and our Temples that are converted to the lawfull worſhip of the true God; and againe in reſpect of the fact, ſuppoſe our Temples were as vncleane as the Babylonians, yet is not God bound to deale with all ſins alike in this world by executing the ſame iudgements here vpon all things that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.<pb n="214" facs="tcp:22760:115"/>There is indeed a time of viſitation when

Do not you remember, how one of your owne fellowſhip and ſociety hath of late time prophecyed and foretold an univerſall maſſacre to come vpon Chriſtendome; &amp; how he is deceyved, the time being paſt which he had nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and limited for this event? Let his example warne you to take heed of being ſo raſh in prophecying an vniuerſal maſſacre of our temples.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, you ſay <hi>if by</hi> Neceſſarie, <hi>I meane in reſpect of humane pleaſure or proffit: as the Lutheranes may thinke they have a neceſsary vſe of images, which they keep in their Churches, &amp;c. this you judge to be but a carnall reaſon and not to ſavour of Gods ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, that by neceſſary vſe, I do not meane ſuch as you ſpeak of in the Lutheranes: but I meane (that which it ſeemes you call ſparing of the purſe) ſuch vſe as ſerves to ſupply the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the faithfull, and to ſupport the burden of ſuch as are oppreſſed with poverty and want, whiles the church is not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the coſt and labour of ſuch buildings: and with all I meane ſuch a circumſtance of place as is in generall of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſe for the aſſembling of people, in as much as the worſhip of God by his people can not be performed conveniently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch helpes of a building. And that this regard of neceſſary vſe is not a carnall reaſon, but ſavouring of Gods ſpirit: it may appeare both by the equity of Gods law even in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when as he would have
<note n="y" place="margin">Hoſ. 6.6. 1. Sam. 21.4 5. &amp;c. Mat. 12.1.7.</note> ceremonies ſome times and in ſome caſes to give place vnto workes of mercy performed for the neceſsities of his people: &amp; much more after the death of Chriſt, when for the proffit of his people, that their outward<pb n="215" facs="tcp:22760:115"/>neceſſities, wants &amp; poverty might be the better ſuſteyned and releeved, he wholly
<note n="z" place="margin">Act. 15.10 Col. 2.14.</note> took away the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall lawes. If God would have his ſtatutes and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments once given concerning his owne holy place and temple to be changed for the neceſſary vſe and proffit of his people: how much more the ſtatutes once given touching other places and temples abuſed to Idolatry?</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, to prove that the reteyning of our temples in reſpect of <hi>neceſſary vſe</hi> is but a carnall reaſon, you alledge divers ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, viz. <hi>Exo. 34.12.13.14.15. Deut. 7.25.26. Ezek
23.14.16, &amp;c</hi> wherin as you ſay, <hi>the ſpirit of God condemneth idols and idoleies, in reſpect of their abomination before God and ſnare that they are vnto men.</hi> I anſwer; that God in his law condemned many things as <hi>an abhomination</hi> vnto himſelf and as <hi>a ſnare</hi> vnto men, which yet are not now of neceſsity to be aboliſhed as in old time: your owne allegations may lead you to ſee the ſame. 1. In Exod. 34. God allowes no compact or covenant with the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there mentioned: and this commandement of God as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by conference with other places of ſcripture was ſo ſtrict that the
<note n="a" place="margin">Ezra. 10.10.11.12.19.—44. Neh.
13.3.23.30.</note> covenants of mariage with ſuch perſons vvere to be diſſolved and broken, even after Children borne vnto them in ſuch mariage, that the infidels ſhould not be <hi>a ſnare</hi> vnto the people of God. This law, notwithſtanding the ſnare feared of old, is now changed and more liberty granted vnto Chriſtians, as the
<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.12.13.14.16.</note> Apoſtle ſhewes: but vnder Moſes the vnbeleeving Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous wife was not ſanctifyed to the beleeving huſband, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vnbeleeving heathniſh huſband ſanctifyed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Ieweſſe his wife: Pauls plea would not have ſerved in <hi>Ezra</hi> his time, when they put away their ſtrange vvives: A tranſgreſſour might not then juſtly have vſed Pauls vvords for reteyning either huſband or vvife: they might not have ſayd; <hi>what knoweſt thou, ô wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thine huſband? or what knoweſt thou, ô man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> Herein therfore vve ſee plainely that for the neceſſitie and benefit of families, God hath changed his lavv, and taken avvay that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:22760:116"/>of <hi>a ſnare,</hi> vvhich he ſo ſeverely commanded of old. 2. In <hi>Deut, 7.25.26.</hi> God allovves not his people to take the ſilver and gold abuſed vnto Idolatry: not ſo much as to turne it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their civil vſe, by taking it to themſelves, or bringing it into their houſes; &amp; this in reſpect of <hi>the ſnare and abomination</hi> you ſpeak of: The tranſgreſſion of this law was the
<note n="c" place="margin">Ioſh. 7.1. &amp;c.</note> deſtruction of Achan and his familye, and a trouble vnto all Iſrael. But now this law is changed, and the reſpect of the ſnare and the abomination is taken away, as appeareth in the
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 10 27.</note>
                        <hi>Idolothytes</hi> now permitted vnto our vſe, which heretofore were vnlawfull, as well as the ſilver and gold mentioned in your allegation. 3, as for that place, <hi>Ezek. 23.14.16.</hi> It doth not appeare that the images there ſpoken of were religious images, but rather civill pictures, images of the Babylonians, ſuch as was the
<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 22.20.</note> image of
<hi>Caeſar</hi> in his coyne: And therfore were not vnlawfull even in the time of the law, otherwiſe then by immoderate and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vſe: and ſo even many other lawfull things became
<note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 69.22.</note> 
                        <hi>a ſnare and a ruine</hi> vnto men. So that the <hi>ſnare</hi> condemned in your allegations is ſuch, as that the ſtrength and ſtaine thereof depended either vpon a ceremoniall commandement from vvhich vve are freed; or vpon an vnlavvfull vſe, which you can not juſtly impute vnto vs in the vſe of our temples.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, vvhereas you ſay, that <hi>if this my exception ſhould take place, we ſhould have very few idols deſtroyed, for they that are Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected, will finde ſome neceſſary vſe for every Idol, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their ſuperſtition. The gentrie may weare the popes hallowed golden crucifixes, and other ſacred Iewels, for broches in their hatts, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, 1. You ought to put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt Idols themſelves, and the places vvhere they have bene vvorſhipped, as the
<note n="g" place="margin">Diſcov. p. 133.</note> marginall note on Barow acknovvled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: Theſe you do vniuſtly confound togather at every turne in your reaſoning; ſeing more deteſtation is to be ſhevved againſt the Idols, then againſt their houſes. 2, As for Popiſh Idols, hallowed crucifixes, their ladies images, and ſuch like things converted vnto ornaments of temples and of the gentry;<pb n="217" facs="tcp:22760:116"/>they are not things of neceſſary vſe in either of thoſe reſpects that I noted before: they are neither neceſſary circumſtances in the worſhip of God; neither doth this kinde of reteyning them help to ſupply the neceſsities of the faithfull: for if theſe gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den implements vvere broken quite in peeces and molten againe, the poore and other faithfull men might then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard have as much and more benefit and neceſſary vſe of them then before; but vvith our temples it is quite contrary in both reſpects. 3, though vve may vſe the plenty of the earth even for orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo, as you alledge before fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Pſ. 24.1. 1. Cor. 10.26.</hi> yet as the Apoſtle ſhevves in the ſame place, vve may alſo better forbeare the vſe of ſuch things whereof vve enioy a plenty; then of other things vvhereof we ſtand in great neceſſitie. As fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this that the earth is the Lords, the Apoſtle
<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 10 26. with verſ.
28.</note> proves vve may have a lavvfull vſe of ech creature therein: ſo from the fulnes, plenty and variety of creatures, he ſhevves that in ſome caſes vve ſhould forbeare the vſe of one rather then an other: and of what rather then of ſuch vaine, and vnneceſſary ornaments, as you ſpeak of? 4. As for copes and other hallowed veſtments, there is alſo a manifeſt difference betwixt them and our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: for whatſoever others may think, that ſkilles not, while we ſee that an houſe is of neceſſary vſe in the ſervice of God, &amp; that the ſurplice is but a ſurplus, a ſuperfluous thing of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vſe: And hereby you may plainely diſcerne the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; becauſe not onely that very ſame ſurplice which Papiſts vſed and defiled with their vſe, is vnlawfull: but any other ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice newly made for a miniſteriall garment, yea though the forme in ſome part be altered, though it be not conſecrated as the
<note n="i" place="margin">Pontifical. par. 2. de benedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. indum.</note> Popiſh veſtments were, yet being of no neceſſary vſe in the ſervice of God, is ſtill vnlawfull: neither do I think that you would willingly weare ſuch an albe: but I hope you vvill not ſay ſo of all temples new made, as of the <hi>Zuyder Kerck</hi> in this city: And yet if you will argue againſt our temples as againſt a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice: then are we to have no temple at all, but to meet <hi>ſub dio</hi> vnder the welkin; becauſe vve are to have no ſurplice at all. If in<pb n="218" facs="tcp:22760:117"/>your annotations on the holy ſcriptures you ſhould expound the other commandements of God on this manner, you would yet prove a greater corrupter of his law and ſeducer of his people.</p>

                     <p>VVHen you argued that our temples were to be deſtroyed becauſe they ſerve to nouriſh ſuperſtition, I ſhewed the weaknes of this argument, becauſe of the inconvenience that would follow; namely, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many private houſes which both of ancienter and later times have bene defiled with Idols, ſhould likewiſe be deſtroyed, being nurſeries of ſuperſtition as well as other publike places: Touching this

<hi>medius terminus</hi> or as an argument to infer the concluſion, as if I had vſed this Syllogiſme:

                           <item>Therfore, al nurſeries of ſuperſtition are not to be deſtroyed.</item>
                        </list> From hence you might have diſcerned the force of your reaſon, drawne from the nouriſhing of ſuperſtition, refuted. 2. If this kinde of reaſoning in me may not be admitted, then may I in like maner tel you when you ſeek to infer inconveniencies vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, by the cope, mitre, ſurplice, &amp; ſuch like things; that you change the ſtate of the queſtion betwixt vs, vvhich is not about veſtments and ſurplices, but about places and temples abuſed vnto Idolatry. 3. It is yourſelf vvho indeed ſeek to chang the ſtate of the queſtion, in that you ſay, our queſtion is <hi>of Idols,</hi> which it is not, but onely of Idolies, or places abuſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry, as may appeare by the queſtions propounded in my
<note n="k" place="margin">Fol. 2. a.</note>firſt writings, accepted of by you: neither have you proved our Temples to be Idols, that ſo by that meanes you might bring in Idols within the compaſſe of the queſtion. 4. You do here contradict your ſelf, when you ſay, the queſtion is <hi>of Idolies, and not of houſes or other things polluted with Idolatrie:</hi> For, I pray you, what is an Idolie, but an houſe or place polluted with Idolatrie? As publique houſes polluted with Idols, are publique Idolies; ſo are private houſes polluted with Idolatrie, private Idolies: And therfore both in the Syriaque and Arabique tranſlations of <hi>1. Cor.
8.10.</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Idolie,</hi> they have <hi>the houſe of Idols:</hi> and in other places of Scripture, theſe Idolies are called
<note n="l" place="margin">Iudg. 17.4.5.</note> 
                        <hi>houſes of Idols, and houſes of Gods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſay, <hi>there is no law of God to deſtroy ſuch civill houſes, as there is to destroy idolies, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer: ſeing God gave vnto Iſrael the cities and houſes of the Canaanites to dwell in, when as he commanded the publique places of their Idolatry to be demoliſhed, as you confeſſe: this confirmes that which I ſayd, and ſhewes that the commandement of deſtroying pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique idolies did not depend merely vpon the nouriſhing of<pb n="221" facs="tcp:22760:118"/>Idolatry, for then the private idolies ſhould have bene deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed alſo for their nouriſhing of Idolatry: becauſe the like ſins deſerve and call for the like judgement. And this appeares yet further from your owne allegation compared with other ſcriptures: for vvhereas in <hi>Deut. 6.10.11.</hi> God allowes Iſrael to dwell in the cities and houſes of the Canaanites, to enioy their welles, their vineyards and olive trees; yet at an other time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of his owne will, he
<note n="m" place="margin">2. Kin. 3 19.25.</note> commands the cities and houſes of Idolatrous Moabites to be deſtroyed; every faire tree to be felled; all their fountaines of water to be ſtopt; and every good field to be marred with ſtones; to ſhew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of their ſin, which yet he would not have to be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed againſt the Canaanites by the ſame meanes, although the ſnare and danger of being nouriſhed in Idolatry and other ſin, was greater and more to be feared from the Canaanites then from the Moabites. If God tooke ſuch a different courſe with Idolatrous and nouriſhers of ſuperſtition vnder the law; it ought not to ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs that he declares his deſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry now vnder the Goſpell by other meanes and maner then vnder the law, according to the counſell of his owne will.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, you ſay, I have <hi>no reaſon to compare civill houſes polluted with Idolatry, with Idols or Idolies: ſeing even Gods owne houſe was polluted with idolatrie, and yet was not counted an Idolie, or deſtroyed, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Suppoſe I had no reaſon to compare civill houſes with Idolies as you ſay; yet your reaſon from Gods houſe doth not warrant you ſo to ſay: for the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God having many priviledges which civil houſes had not, might be exempted from the judgement of preſent deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then they: &amp; therfore your plea is inſufficient. 2, though Gods owne houſe, when it was polluted with Idolatry, vvas not to be deſtroyed, but cleanſed as <hi>2. Kin. 23.</hi> yet have you no warrant to ſay, that <hi>It was not counted an Idolie:</hi> but as it vvas ſometimes denominate of other ſins, and called

<note n="o" place="margin">2. Kin. 21 4.5. &amp;c. Ier. 2.10.11 &amp; 3.11.

And though God gave no law for deſtroying of this his temple when it became a nurſery of ſuperſtition, yet this hinders not but that it did ſometimes match and overmatch the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the heathens in nouriſhing of Idolatry. The vvill of God vvas that ſome Idolies ſhould be deſtroyed &amp; ſome not. 4, for <hi>civil dwelling houſes</hi> where Idols have bene worſhiped, though they be not <hi>ſuch</hi> moniments and nurſeries of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſome other publique Idolies, that impeacheth not my aſſertion: it is enough for me, that they have in ſome meaſure bene nurſeries of ſuperſtition: Even among the publique Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies themſelves, ſome temples of Antichriſt are not <hi>ſuch</hi> nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuperſtition as ſome other be, which are ten times more devoutly obſerved and waited on, then the reſt. 5, how know you that that all the temples of the heathens had no ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill dwellings in any part of them, &amp; that they were (as you ſay) <hi>merely Idolies?</hi> how know you but that ſome of them might be inhabited, in ſuch maner as your Idolie is, reſerving the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall place for their Idol ſervice and devotion? your making of them mere Idolies in this ſenſe, ſeemes to be a mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and affirmation without proofe. 6, I may rather ſay on the contrary, that they were not merely Idolies becauſe ſome part of them were put to civill vſes as one of your owne<pb n="223" facs="tcp:22760:119"/>

<note n="r" place="margin">Zeph. 1.5 2. Kin. 23.12.</note> Altars vvere made vpon the houſe tops, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vpon Kings or Princes houſes as vpon <hi>Ahaz</hi> his chamber: The reſort vnto ſuch places and the ſcandall by the Idol-worſhip there performed might nouriſh ſuperſtition more then the devotion performed in ſome other obſcure Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and groves of the heathens. 8, How frivolous is that which you write of the heathen <hi>Demetrius?</hi> how know you that <hi>he would never have ſpoken of the dwelling houſes in Epheſus</hi> as he did of Dianaes temple, concerning her maieſtie? ſeing that which he ſpoke was for his
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 19.24.25.</note> gaine: and ſeing his gaine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in ſelling litle temples of Diana: it was ſutable and fit for his purpoſe that men ſhould think their private dwelling houſes would be more holy if they had thoſe litle temples or ſhrines of <hi>Diana</hi> in them, and therfore who can ſay but that he would vpon occaſion complaine that the maieſtie of <hi>Diana</hi> and of her great temple would be deſpiſed, if men did not ſhew their devotion in buying thoſe litle temples for the hallowing of their houſes and for the maintenance of her worſhip? And what if he would not ſo have complained? yet might their houſes in Epheſus have bene Idolies, in reſpect of their

                        <hi>did burne incenſe vnto it, and not for that there was no neceſsary vſe therof. And the ſame cauſe (beſides other) lyeth against your idol temples: for to this day, many people burne incenſe vnto them, eſteming and uſing them as ſanctified places for the incenſe of their prayers, and other religious works. If you require a proof, you may ſee it in this citie, if not at other times, at least on Sacraments day, ſo called: when above other dayes, the papiſts viſit their ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Temple ſolemnly, ſome of them barefooted: &amp; if the dores be ſhut that they cannot goe in, yet they doe their devotion in proceſsion about the idolie. And wherfore may we think, have the</hi> Nunnes <hi>a key of your chappel (as is reported) but for to doe honour to their</hi> Dianaes ſhrine: <hi>it is for no devotion to your worſhip therin, you may be ſure, but rather that they may continue</hi> Temple keepers <hi>(or worſhipers) of their former gods, as the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>

                        <hi>were of their Diana. If you plead, that theſe burne not incenſe to the Temples, but to God in them: the ſame I anſwer for the Iſraelits, that they alſo burnt incenſe to God, before the braſen ſerpent, for they were not ſo ſottiſh as to worſhip a peece of Braſſe. But the ſcripture vſeth to call the worſhiping of God, by or before an idol, the worſhiping of the idol it ſelf: as in Act. 7.41. they are ſayd to offer ſacrifice vnto the idol, wheras in Exod. 32. it appeareth they ſacrificed to the Lord, the God that had brought them out of Egypt. So they that worſhiped in the idolatrous groves, are ſayd to</hi>

As the holy mount after the law was delivered, and the ſound of the Trumpet ended became

18.4. which I my ſelf before noted; and the ſtate of our controverſy which<pb n="228" facs="tcp:22760:122"/>is concerning things abuſed vnto Idolatry, doth alſo manifeſte vnto every one: yet that hinders not but we may alſo conſider this as a concurring cauſe to be ioyned with the former, and this ſo much the rather touching the deſtruction of the braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, becauſe the originall thereof was not for Idol ſervice. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, if without regard of neceſſary vſe ech temple abuſed vnto Idolatry muſt be deſtroyed, as the braſen ſerpent was for the abuſe thereof; then not onely the temples built &amp; dedicated by heathens &amp; papiſts but alſo the temples newly built by the proteſtants for the true and lawfull worſhip of God, ſuch as are the Zuyder-Kerck in this city and divers more in other places, (if the the papiſts ſhould get them but one moneth or week in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their handes &amp; ſing one maſſe therein) ſhould in like maner be raſed and demoliſhed. But you muſt yet ſtreyne your wit to draw more ſubtile conſequences before you can ſhew vs ſuch temples in the belly of the braſen-ſerpent, which by your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing you would make to be ſuch a devouring Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <p>Fourthly, you ſay: <hi>the ſame cauſe lyeth againſt our Idol-temples: for to this day many people burne incenſe vnto them:</hi> and for proofe hereof, you alledge that <hi>in this city if not at other times, at leaſt on Sacraments day, ſo called, we may ſee the papists viſit their ancient temple ſolemnely; ſome of them barefooted, &amp;c.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer. 1. This action of the Papiſts whereof you ſpeak is not in any publique ſolemne meeting, as your words might make the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to imagine, and ſo deceive him thereby: but a thing done by ſtealth of ſome ſuperſtitious perſons, who as I heare do now and then viſit that temple as a holy place: The Magiſtrate of this city doth puniſh the Papiſts even for their ſecret meetings in private houſes: and much leſs will they ſuffer publique and ſolemne aſſemblies for Idol-ſervice. If ſuch a viſitation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as this is be a juſt cauſe of deſtroying them, then what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be free from deſtruction, if the Papiſts may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at any time to come neere it and to pollute it with their devotions? It is affirmed by many, (and it is agreeable to the Romiſh profeſſion) that the Churchyard and Church newly built in this city, have in the night ſeaſon bene viſited by the Papiſts and conſecrated by their prieſt or Biſhop for the buriall of their dead, which are often buried there: And now by your reaſoning, becauſe the Papiſts have on this manner burned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe vnto it, and hallowed it for their vſe, and eſteeme it a ſanctifyed place, it ſhould be deſtroyed as well as the braſen ſerpent was. 2, The ſuperſtitious devotions which by ſome ſtragling people are now and then performed at this temple whereof you ſpeak, were in like maner practiſed by them, (as thoſe that have ſeene do teſtify) even then when it was turned vnto a civill vſe and made a pack houſe for wares: for vnto ſuch vſe it was by the Magiſtrates appoyntment heretofore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, vntill of later time, the city encreaſing, they found a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vſe of it for the people to meet in, vnto the ſervice of God. And this being ſo, that the reteyning of this place for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:22760:123"/>civill vſe hath given liberty vnto Papiſts to burne incenſe vnto it (as you ſpeak) as vvel as the religious vſe thereof: then are you as deep in this ſin as others whom you accuſe for nouriſhing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: for it hath bene and is the maner of your people to reteyne a civil vſe of theſe hallowed places for the buriall of the dead. Though you have not power to deſtroy them, yet ought you to forbeare the vſe of theſe hallowed places, if there be ſuch a ſinfull nouriſhing of ſuperſtition thereby. Yea if any difference be, it is the reteyning of theſe places for civill vſe that gives the Papiſt more liberty and occaſion to performe and continue their devotions ſtill, becauſe they think that our vſe of their temples in the ſervice of God doth more pollute them, and make them vnfit for their vſe then turning of them to pack houſes. 3, Suppoſe that there were offence given in retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this particular temple which you mention &amp; which ſome Papiſts do more dote vpon, then vpon other places; in reſpect of ſome miraculous vertue and holynes which they have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined and beleeved to be in it through their popiſh deluſions, yet this may not ſerve to condemne all other in like manner: And leaſt of all can it ſerve to condemne the place of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, about which in particular this our preſent controverſy is. The vvoman that occaſioned this diſpute &amp; pretended ſcruple of joyning with our congregation in reſpect of our temple, need not to be offended at this place of ours, for the ſuperſtition that is practiſed in an other place.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, you aſk <hi>wherfore the Nunnes have a key of our Chappel (as is reported) but for to do honour to their Dianaes ſhrine, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: 1. The report which you repeat is a falſe report and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: The Baguines or vvomen (whom you call Nunnes) have no key vvhereby they may come into our Chappell: neither have had theſe many yeares; And therfore directly contrary vnto that which the tovvne cleark of Epheſus ſayd boaſting, &amp; vvhich you
<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 19.35.</note> alledge for them; they may take vp a lamentation and ſay; vvho knovveth not, that vve are no longer temple-keepers nor vvorſhipers in the Chapell, vvhich is taken from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:22760:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>vs: vve have loſt poſſeſſion and have no keyes of entrance, &amp;c. Regard not ſuch ſleight reports: if you were vviſe you vvould not mention them, vntil you had more vvarrant &amp; aſſurance of the truth thereof. 2, your ſelf are rather a Sexton or templ-keeper of an Idol-te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, having obteyned to keep for your vſe a key of the library in that temple which you reſort vnto &amp; yet would have it to be deſtroyed and raſed: No Nunnes have any ſuch dore in our temple to be opened by them at their pleaſure as you have there: But I pray you tell vs, ſince you would not have theſe temples once abuſed by Antichriſt to be exempted from ruine and deſtruction more then the reſt: would you be content thus to have kept a key of ſome cel in Appollos Oracle at Delphos, or of Baal-zebubs te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in Ekron where you might dayly have heard the divel ſpeaking alowd in his owne perſon? If ſo, ſurely you do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leſſe hate Idol-te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples &amp; devilles houſes, then many of thoſe vvhom you do ſo much accuſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, as for the diſtinction which you vvould preoccupate viz. of <hi>burning incenſe not to the temples but to God in them:</hi> though I condemne thoſe that ſhall make ſuch diſtinctions to defend their ſuperſtition withall: yet whereas you ſay further, that you
<hi>anſwer the ſame thing for the Iſraelites, that they alſo burnt incenſe to God, before the brazen ſerpent, for they were not ſo ſottiſh as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a peece of braſſe:</hi> this your ſaying is vnwarrantable: for the folly &amp; ſottiſhnes of Idolaters leads the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to as great abſurdities as the worſhiping of a peece of braſſe:

If you meane a neceſſary vſe in any meaſure at all, I deny not the the ſame: for there is nothing ſo ſmall or abiect but ſome vſe may be made thereof: and even after theſe things were turned into duſt, there might vſe be made of that duſt, as there vvas: but you pervert my words if you ſtand ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy vnto the letter thereof: vvhereas I ſpoke of the great prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that might redound vnto the maintenance of the Church: and namely ſuch as might be proportionable vnto the worth of many temples, of ten thouſand Churches happily in ſome one Kingdome: and vvhat is a baſketfull of duſt about which you trifle in compariſon of this great commodity employed to ſupply the wants of the faithfull? 2.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:22760:127"/>writing, your counſell is that <hi>we diſcuſſe things by the word of God, not of man:</hi> you are herein like vnto a deceitfull champion who being to combat with an other, would aforehand agree vpon the weapon and aſſiſtance to be vſed: but yet contrary to agreement brings with him into the feeld both other weapons and aſſiſtance then he pretended at the firſt: for ſo you making ſhew that you would vſe the ſword of the ſpirit onely, do yet bring with you other carnall weapons and a company of hyred Souldiers which you couch cloſely togather and lay them in ambuſh: and here of a ſodaine they ſtep forth, firſt a band of Emperours &amp; Princes as of <hi>Conſtantine the great, Theodoſius, Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius, Iovius, Carolus magnus or Charles the great;</hi> and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of theſe horſmen and Charets makes a terrible noyſe in the eares of many: after theſe you bring forth a ſecond band of Popiſh prelates, as <hi>Geroldus, Wigbertus, Vnwannus,</hi> to come ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling in their rochets againſt me: &amp; beſides theſe divers others.

                     <p n="3">3. As you have alledgedged the examples of theſe for breakin downe of temples, ſo might you as eaſily have alledged their examples for the maintenance of many notorious corruptions ſome of them for the ſuperſtitious vſe of the ſigne of the croſſe; ſome of them to allow primates and metropolitanes: ſome of them to allow even the maſſe itſelf and all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of popery.

                     <p n="4">4. The temples which theſe Princes and Biſhops deſtroyed were all of them heathniſh and built by the Pagans for the worſhip of falſe Gods: other temples ſuch as ours built for the ſervice of Chriſt, they deſtroyed not, but built ſuch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as you would now have to be demoliſhed.

                     <p>But to come more particularly vnto your examples: The firſt is, that <hi>Conſtantine the Emperour raſed down Venus Temple, with all statues and moniments of it:</hi> I anſwer, 1. It is vncertaine whether this thing was done by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> or not: for <hi>Euſebius</hi> the author that records the ſame is
<note n="c" place="margin">R. P. de Politeria Ec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleſ. lib.
2. cap. 23. 24. 25. 26. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger. Ele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. trihaereſ. Serrar. c. 29</note> often taxed for many errours in matters of fact deſcribed by him. His teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is therfore doubtfull and not free from ſuſpicion. 2. That Temple is recorded by <hi>Euſebius</hi> to have bene an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wicked place, not onely for heathniſh Idolatry, but alſo for other monſtrous and vnnaturall crimes committed in the ſame, which are alſo alledged as a cauſe why it was deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed: Therfore the deſtruction thereof is no ſufficient warrant for the ſubverſion of our temples. 3, It is alſo noted by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> in the ſame Chapter which you cite, that this temple of <hi>Venus</hi> was ſituate in a dearne place on a top of mount
<hi>Libanus,</hi> out of the way &amp; remote from converſation of men: therfore could it not even by his relation be converted vnto ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary vſes as our temples are.</p>
                     <p>4. That Idol temples were not deſtroyed by
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> it is confeſſed by an
<note n="d" place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Hiſt. lib. 5. c.
20.</note> other of your witneſſes: Therfore though he forbade the Idolaters to vſe them, yet do not your witneſſes agree that his conſcience required the deſtruction of them all together acccording to your doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond example alledged by you is of
<hi>Constantine</hi> alſo, that he deſtroyed <hi>the Python in Cilicia with his temple.</hi> I anſwer, 1. The truth of this fact may alſo be juſtly called into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, conſidering how vncertaine or rather fabulous things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by that <hi>Socrates</hi> your witneſſe. In the
<note n="e" place="margin">Socrates Hiſt. lib. 1. cap.
13.</note> former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter next vnto this alledged by you there is recorded the finding out of the holy croſſe by <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of
<hi>Conſtantine:</hi> the miraculous diſcerning of the ſame from the two other croſſes of the theeves crucifyed with Chriſt, by the meanes of
<hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> &amp;c. 2. If the things there recorded by
<hi>Socrates</hi> be true, then was the ſuperſtition of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> very great; in taking a<pb n="238" facs="tcp:22760:128"/>peece of that croſſe vvhich his mother found and ſent vnto him, and hiding it in his owne ſtatue or image, beleeving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that the city ſhould be preſerved ſafe, vvhere it was kept: in taking alſo the nayles which faſtned the hands of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the croſſe, and putting them in his horſe bridles and in his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met (as an
<note n="f" place="margin">Theodoret Hiſt. lib. 1. c.

<note n="g" place="margin">Zach. 14.20.</note> Prophecie, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the holynes vpon the bridles of the horſes. Such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are of no great authority with vs. 3. Theſe Authors wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe further that in
<hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, they did
<note n="h" place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. lib. 20 cap.

<hi>Mamre</hi> eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Idol-place vvhere heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſacrifices had bene offred. Do you think that ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to be regarded and follovved?</p>
                     <p>For a third example you tell vs that <hi>Theodoſius commanded the temples of Idols to be overthrowne:</hi> I anſwer, 1. Your hiſtorians witneſſing this fact are ſo full of apparant fables that there is no great credit to be given vnto them. As for <hi>Theodoret</hi> to go no further then theſe chapters alledged by you: in the

.37.</note> firſt of them he telles great wonders of <hi>Eunomius</hi> the Biſhop that alone reſiſted an army when others fainted, &amp;c. in the
<note n="m" place="margin">ibid. c. 20</note> ſecond place, the ſtory of <hi>Macedonius</hi> the divine eremite that was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſcriptures, is related: in the
<note n="n" place="margin">ibid. c. 21.</note> third place is the ſtory of the Divel that at firſt would not ſuffer the fire to burne the Idol-temple, but was after driven to run away by the vertue of holy vvater and the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp;c. And <hi>Sozomen</hi> in the

<hi>Theodoſius:</hi> If he had thought them ſimply vnlavvfull according

<hi>Theodoſius</hi> into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with a vaine excommunication, &amp;c. And therfore not the conſciences of ſuch men but the word of God which is the perfect law of liberty muſt be our guide.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place you alledge, that <hi>Gaudentius and Iovius ruinated ſuch places in the reigne of Honorius.</hi> Anſw. 1. Though they did ſo in one city, in <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet this ſhewes not that they did ſo in other places, or that they thought all others bound to imitate their example: for oftentimes ſuch works are done vpon occaſion of particular reſpects and ſpecialll provocations, which at other times and places they would not doe: as vvas alſo noted before in the practiſe of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. 2. As for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> your Author, though he approve this fact in them; yet it appeares els vvhere, that at ſome other times and places he
<note n="q" place="margin">Auguſt. ad Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Epiſt.
154.</note> allowed the reteyning of them: and ſhewes reaſon for their converting to religious vſes, <hi>even as ſacrilegious and impious perſons themſelves are changed or converted vnto true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And his reaſon is not to be deſpiſed: ſeing living temples of the divel abuſed vnto Idolatry being more capable of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſin may be employed and turned vnto the ſervice of God; why not other dead temples made of vvood and ſtone? 3. This your vvitneſſe doth yet further condemne you, in that he
<note n="r" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> allovves the converting of Idol-temples and groves vnto the vvorſhip of the true God, or vnto other common and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique vſes, but not vnto other private vſes and commodities: vvhereas on the contrary you that do deny ſuch publique vſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:22760:129"/>of them in the ſervice of God, are yet content to employ them to your ovvne private vſe and benefit as by ſtudy in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Your fift example is, that <hi>Carolus magnus when he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Saxonie, did the like to the Idolies of Maydenburgh and Mars mount.</hi> I anſvver. 1. <hi>Cranzius</hi> the popiſh vvriter vvhom you alledge for theſe things is of ſuch authority, that for many matters the golden legend of lyes deſerves as much credit as he: He telles

                     <p>In the ſixt place you come from Emperours and Princes vnto Biſhops, deſtroying Idol-temples; and here you tell how <hi>Marcus Biſhop of Arethuſa performed the like ſervice in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines dayes.</hi> But (not to ſpeak further of the authors vncertainty that records this fact) ſeing the deſtruction of Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples is a worke of the civil Magiſtrate, and by them to be executed as your ſelf confeſſe; how could <hi>Marcus</hi> performe this work without vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacion of the civil ſword? If you ſay that leave and authority from the Prince did warrant him thus to do, then by the like grant and warrant from Princes you may allow Biſhops to be high commiſſioners and civill Magiſtrates: And they may as well alledge theſe examples of Biſhops for maintenance of their double authority, as you do for the deſtruction of temples. But more particularly touching this example when you come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to alledge it the ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>Your 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. example is of <hi>Biſhop Porphyrie that ſhewed the like zele at Gaza.</hi> I anſwer, 1. It appeares out of
<hi>Sigonius</hi> in the place you alledg, that Biſhop <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> was ſtird vp vnto this fact by the iniuries that he received from the gentiles which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayled in <hi>Gaza:</hi> and therfore his zele againſt Idolies is not very evident. 2, The maner of dealing which this Biſhop and the Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> that joyned with him, did vſe in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying vnto the empreſſe <hi>Eudoxia</hi> touching a Sonne to be borne vnto her, to win her aſsiſtance in this matter, makes their zele the more to be ſuſpected. 3. Their Baptiſing of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Childe with the ſigne of the croſſe even at the ſame time when they got licenſe to deſtroy the Idol-temples at <hi>Gaza,</hi> doth ſhew that you may as well alledge their examples for the<pb n="242" facs="tcp:22760:130"/>maintenance of other ſuperſtitions, as for the countenancing of your opinion in this controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Your 8. example is of <hi>Biſhop Abdas that did the like among the Perſians, vpon their temples conſecrated to the fire.</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> who relates this fact (not in the 3. booke, as you cite the ſame, but in the 10. book and 3.

<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17.22 23. &amp;c.</note> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Paul who though he ſhewed the errour of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> yet did he not himſelf deſtroy their altars and idols; as this biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop did without any lawful authority: as alſo by the woful eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that followed, namely that vpon this fact all the Churches of the Chriſtians were deſtroyed and overthrowne by the Perſians; and not onely this; but here vpon alſo was rayſed a moſt cruell and extreme perſecution of the Chriſtians which continued for the ſpace of 30 yeares together. And if this example ought to be followed, then ought you and your people to come with your hammers to break our temples, but I need not to dehort you from ſuch folly.</p>
                     <p>Your 9. example is that <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome ſent men to do the like worke in Phaenicia.</hi> Anſw. 1. The men whom he ſent about this worke, were (as the author alledged by you

If the example of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> be of any worth in your eyes, we may then alledge the ſame againſt your oppugning of ſet formes of prayer, which he allowed in the worſhip of God, as appeares by the hymnes and antiphones which as an other of your witneſſes
<note n="c" place="margin">Socrates hiſt. lib. 6. c.

                     <p>Your 10th. example is that <hi>Biſhop Geroldus burned to aſhes, a grove which the Sclavi had in ſacred reverence.</hi> Anſwer.

                        <hi>God would let the reader ſee how you are given over to blindnes of heart, in iudging ſpirituall things: by that blindnes which is in you in diſcerning carnall things, and which are ſet before all mens eyes.</hi> As for <hi>Geroldus</hi> the popiſh Biſhop, whoſe example you object vnto me: 1. It doth not agree with that which you propounded to ſhew at the beginning viz. the examples of <hi>Chriſtian Princes &amp; of Biſhops having leave from ſuch:</hi> for where doth it appeare that he had ſuch
<hi>leave</hi> to do this thing? It doth rather appeare, to be a ſodaine motion, and an occaſional thing falling out in his iourney, when the ſtory ſhewes that
<note n="o" place="margin">Helmold. Chron. Sla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vor. lib. 1. c.
84.</note> meeting with ſuch a grove in his way he lept from his horſe, and fell vpon that worke exhorting others to follow him. 2. The deſtruction of ſuch a Grove is not to be matched with the deſtruction of our temples, in reſpect of the neceſſary vſe wherevnto they may be employed in the ſervice of God, ſo as thoſe trees and hedges could not. 3, It is noted of this <hi>Geroldus,</hi> that he
<note n="p" place="margin">Cranzius VVandal. lib. 4. c.
21.</note> went to Roome to be conſecrated &amp; made Biſhop by the Pope; and though in the way the theeves met him and ſmote and wounded him in the forehead, yet<pb n="245" facs="tcp:22760:131"/>would not that Balam turne back or deſiſt from his journey: that he

<hi>Geroldus</hi> againſt yourſelf for the defence of all popery, even as you do againſt vs for the deſtruction of our temples.</p>
                     <p>Your 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> example is that <hi>Wighertas Biſhop of Merſburgh did likewiſe:</hi> If he did but likewiſe, then the like anſwer may ſerve for this, that was given vnto the former examples. Touching this popiſh <hi>Wigbert,</hi> it is
<note n="“" place="margin">Magdeb. centur. 11. cap. 10. col. 602.</note> recorded indeed that he did deſtroy a certaine grove conſecrate vnto the Idole <hi>Zuttiber,</hi> and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it vnto a plaine: but it is withall recorded that he did in the ſame place build a Chappel vnto an other Idol, namely vnto <hi>St. Roman.</hi> And where he had remooved the heathniſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, even in the ſame place he ſet vp popiſh Idolatry. Are we to be guided by ſuch examples?</p>
                     <p>Your 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Example is that <hi>Vnwannus of Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burgh cut downe all the idolatrous groves in his dioceſſe.</hi> I anſwer, 1. It is to be obſerved how you omit the title of this <hi>Vnwannus,</hi> being Archbiſhop of Hamburgh, as your author in the
<note n="r" place="margin">Cranz. metrop. l. 4 c. 1.</note> place alledged by you doth acknowledge: So before you omitted the title of
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> being Archbiſh. of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> Thoſe that were but Biſhops you give all them their titles: but not ſo to either of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops. It ſeemes you thought that ſo long as any were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Biſhops, the reader might conceave they were no vſurping Biſhops: and ſo have regarded their examples the more, that name being given by the holy Ghoſt vnto his miniſters: but if you had named Archbiſhops, the reader might have concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the weaknes of their examples, ſerving as well to ſtabliſh the primacy of Archbiſhops, as to deſtroy temples 2, It is further to be obſerved, that this <hi>Vnwannus</hi> was not onely an Archbiſhop but alſo a popiſh Archbiſhop, that
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> received his pall of Pope <hi>Benedict the</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. that he built chappels in honour of Saincts, as that of <hi>S. Vitus</hi> at <hi>Breme.</hi> The reader that conſiders this, might think that his example in deſtroying temples is of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:22760:132"/>leſs weight, when he gave ſo foule an example for building Idolatrous temples. 3, even that which <hi>Vnwannus</hi> did in cutting downe groves is againſt yourſelf: for of the groves he made Churches:
<note n="t" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>ex lucis fecit eccleſias renovari,</hi> &amp;c. This had bene vnlawfull in the time of the lavv: The groves of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites might not be converted vnto ſuch vſe. If this example of the Archbiſhop may be imitated, then is the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Deut. 12.</hi> a ceremoniall and temporary ordinance, not binding vs in theſe times.</p>
                     <p>Your 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Example is, that <hi>in Lituania, the temples &amp; Altars of Idols were demoliſhed.</hi> According to your owne authors the thing vvas done on this maner:

This is the worthy example that you propound vnto vs. From this barbarous adulterer and Idolaters conſcience you will informe and illuminate the eyes and conſciences of all faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people at this day: from the rude and blinde practiſe of theſe whom by your owne profeſſion you cannot eſteeme to be otherwiſe then a falſe Church, you inſult againſt all the Churches of Chriſte: And of theſe mungrilles, half heathens, and half Papiſts you ſay of them with the reſt, that <hi>all theſe beare witneſſe to the true meaning of Gods law written in their hearts other wiſe then in ours, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your laſt example is, <hi>And now of late the Chriſtians in France</hi> (<hi>as at</hi> Rochel) <hi>ruinated the popiſh temples there.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Had you noted any Chronicle or good writers where this act is particularly deſcribed, with the circumſtances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hereof, the reader might thereby have had ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame, which now your writing doth not afford. 2, As for ruinating ſome popiſh temples, it is that which hath alſo bene practiſed in divers other countries, and even in this city as that of the Minorites, &amp;c. Yet this hinders not but that they have the true meaning of Gods law written in their hearts otherwiſe then in yours that require all ſuch of neceſsity to be deſtroyed, and do alſo ſeparate from the worſhip of God in all ſuch places: As Iſrael was to deſtroy
<note n="z" place="margin">Ioſh. 6. &amp; 7. ch.</note>
                        <hi>Iericho</hi> the firſt city of Canaan which they came vnto after they paſſed Iorden; and to keep others for their vſe: ſo many Chriſtians in the beginning of the reformation to ſhew their deteſtation of popery deſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed ſome popiſh temples, and yet reſerved the reſt for their neceſſary vſe in the ſervice of God. 3. As for them of <hi>Rochel</hi> in particular; the ancienteſt miniſters of the French Church in this city, as they have teſtifyed vnto me, do not know, neither can learne by any enquiry of their people, ſome whereof have formerly bene members of that particular Church of <hi>Rochel,</hi>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:22760:133"/>that ever the Chriſtians there did make any queſtion or ſcruple of worſhipping God with the reſt of their brethren in any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh temples being once purged from their Idolatry. And therfore vntill you bring better evidence of that which you write, we have reaſon to hold the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Rochel</hi> for our ſelves againſt you. 4. Vpon further enquiry, I am
<note n="“" place="margin">Anno 1618. Iun. 8.</note> now of late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by letters from <hi>Monſieur Loumeau</hi> a reverend miniſter of the Church of <hi>Rochel;</hi> that the ruinating of ſome temples there vvas done not becauſe they thought it vnlawfull to vſe them, but leaſt the Papiſts ſhould have them; that ſome of them were broken downe in reſpect of civil neceſsitie, becauſe they were of importance for fortification in their warres: that at the ſame time when they ruinated ſome, yet they reſerved others for their vſe in the worſhip of God; as namely, a litle temple of the <hi>Nonnes,</hi> wherein they preached long time after others were deſtroyed: and alſo that of the <hi>Convent of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines,</hi> wherein (as he teſtifyeth) they do ſtill preach vnto this day. This being ſo, every one may plainely ſee how you abuſe and pervert the examples of the Chriſtians in the Reformed Churches as though they were witneſſes for you and a bettours of your folly. If a feare of pollution in the vſe of them had cauſed them to pluck them downe: then might their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have bene polluted with the vſe of thoſe two which they reſerved, as well as with the reſt. 5.

                     <p>In the next place you alledge the example of <hi>Marcus Biſhop of Arethuſa</hi> who endured great torture rather then to give one half peny towards the building of an Idol-temple: who for this is regiſtred with honour in our owne book of Martyrs; &amp; you aſk, <hi>how vnlike</hi> I am to him. I anſwer, 1. It is not recorded<pb n="253" facs="tcp:22760:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>that he refuſed to worſhip God in ſuch a place purged from Idolatry; but that he would not help forward the building of ſuch a place, when he knew it ſhould be employed to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Idols: neither am I herein vnlike vnto him, for I hold it to be the duety of a Chriſtian man rather to dy then to give any thing for the furtherance of Idolatry, though it were but a half peny. 2, if the example of this one Martyr be worthy to be regarded, how much more the reſt, which in ſo great a number like a cloude of witneſſes or Martyrs, are regiſtred in our book of Martyrs, al bearing witneſſe againſt you touching the vſe of temples formerly abuſed vnto Idolatry in England and other places? <hi>How vnlike</hi> are you vnto them all? do they not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne your ſchiſming from the churches of Chriſt vpon ſuch pretences? do they not all ſhew the meaning of Gods law to be written in their hearts otherwiſe then in yours? 3, for yourſelf in ſpeciall, I may rather aſk you and ſay: <hi>how vnlike</hi> are you vnto this conſtant and patient Martyr, he enduring ſo much for his religion, and you ſo often changing your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſtayning your ſelf ſo many times with apoſtaſy, as hath bene

                        <hi>you truſt, that God will one day rayſe vp an other Iohn fox to gather and compile the Acts &amp; monuments of his later martyrs, for the vew of poſterity, &amp;c.</hi> vvhen this your owne booke of martyrs ſhalbe compiled and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, what place or memoriall can you expect therein (if things be faithfully regiſtred) but ſuch as <hi>D.

                     <p>Moreover, whereas you do againe repeate the example of
<hi>Theodoſius,</hi> wherevnto I have already given anſwer in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſection; I do yet further anſwer, that your allegation that he <hi>vtterly destroyed</hi> the Idol-temples, is contradicted and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even by the other examples cited by your ſelf: for if after this, the Idol temples at
<hi>Gaza,</hi> at <hi>Carthage</hi> and in <hi>Phaenicia</hi> were deſtroyed vnder the reigne of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and followed <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in the empire, then were they not vtterly deſtroyed by that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> of whom <hi>Theodoret</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:22760:136"/>ſpeakes, in the places by you alledged. As it is a ſure argument that all the high places were not vtterly deſtroyed in the dayes of <hi>Aſa,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> which came after him, deſtroyed
<note n="q" place="margin">2. Chron. 17.6.</note> ſome, that remayned vnto his time: even ſo it is a ſure token that all the Idol temples were not vtterly deſtroyed in the dayes of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whiles according to your owne example others were deſtroyed in the times ſucceeding by <hi>Iovius and Gaudentius,</hi> by <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and by
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with his monkes.</p>
                     <p>Further, to prove our temples vnneceſſary, you plead that <hi>the Apoſtle calleth them their devotions (Sebaſmata) Act. 17.23. which word being elſwhere vſed by him in his Propheſie of the Pope ſhould teach vs to abhorre his temples, &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. 1, though Paul mention the Devotions or <hi>Sebaſmata</hi> of the Athenians Act. 17. yet doth it not follow that he ſpeakes of their temples, themſelves, for he might ſee their devotions though he ſaw not their temples: the
<note n="r" place="margin">Ier. 11.13</note> maner of Idolaters being to have their Altars and images in ſtreetes, and market places, and by the way-ſides and this many times without any houſes or temples built over them. If the open places where ſuch devotions were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely performed, ſhould be aboliſhed as vnneceſſary, then not onely houſes and temples but ſtreets and market places were in like manner alſo to be deſtroyed and made deſolate, for as much as they alſo had bene places to nouriſh ſuperſtition 2, as for the word <hi>Sebaſma</hi> vſed againe <hi>2. Theſ. 2.4.</hi> in a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Pope, that may well be expounded of the Maieſty and honourable eſtate of Kings and Emperours, above whom the Pope exalteth himſelf and thereby is knowne to be Antichriſt; the

25.21 25. &amp;. 27.1</note> like words being elſwhere againe vſed to expreſs the ſame dignity: yet doth not the attributing of this word vnto Princes prove them to be of no neceſſary vſe.

<hi>Bellarmine</hi> of <hi>Becanus,</hi> of <hi>Vorſtius</hi> have bene of late juſtly burned by divers Chriſtian Princes, and yet ſome bookes of the ſame kinde are juſtly reteyned by others for ſome good vſe that may be made of them. 3, if Idolatrous bookes &amp; ſuch as are of curious arts may not be reteyned for ſome good vſe of them, when the evill things are put out: then how guilty are you that reteyne ſuch bookes and that for religious vſe even whiles the evill things are not put out of them: This your vſe of ſuch bookes appeares in the manifold teſtimonies which you bring and alledge out of them. 4, by this your reteyning and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Idolatrous bookes you do plainely condemne and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw yourſelf in this queſtion of temples: for ſeing Idolatrous bookes are ſtrong nouriſhments of Idolatry vnto many, yea<pb n="256" facs="tcp:22760:137"/>far more effectuall therevnto then are any ſhapes of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous buildings; if you can ſtill allow the keeping and vſing of ſuch bookes, while the evill things are not put out, how partiall are you that will not allow the keeping of temples abuſed vnto Idolatry, even when the images, Altars and Idolatrous worſhip are put out of them? And you do yet further condemne yourſelf herein, becauſe in expounding the decalogue you make

                        <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Idolatrous bookes</hi> to be a breach of the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as well as building of temples vnto Idols. Now the breach of the ſecond commandement is ſimply a ſin: and the building of a temple vnto Idols is an heynous ſin though the reteyning of them when they are converted to the true worſhip of God be not ſo. Thus by your practiſe contrary to your doctrine, you ſtreyne out a Gnat and ſwallow a Camel, in diſpenſing with the vſe of Idolatrous bookes, while you condemne the vſe of our temples. How can you blame the Magiſtrates for not vſing their power to aboliſh our temples; whiles yourſelf having power to aboliſh ſome Idolatrous bookes, do yet keep them for your vſe and refuſe to burne them?

It is an idle thing to prevent obiections, where there is no danger of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay that <hi>I affirme it was a hetheniſh ſchoole,</hi> this is alſo ſomething more then you might iuſtly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: for ſuppoſe that I tooke it to be a Iewiſh ſchoole, yet might<pb n="259" facs="tcp:22760:140"/>I ſay as much as I did, viz. <hi>It being as the reſt of the hetheniſh ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp;c.</hi> For both the
<note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> like phraſe is vſed by the Scriptures, when ſpeech is of the Iewes to compare them with
<hi>the rest</hi> of the gentiles, and that the Iewiſh Schooles were nurſeries of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition as well as the gentiles it may appeare by that which followeth hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, though there might be (as you object) a Iewiſh ſchoole in Epheſus, as there was a Iewes Synagogue, yet this hinders not, but <hi>Tyrannus</hi> his ſchoole might be a hetheniſh ſchoole; vnleſſe you could ſhew that there was but one ſchoole in that city.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, you run for help vnto the <hi>great Eagle</hi> of the Iewes (as he is called) and fly vpon his winges, when you tell vs in the name of your doctour <hi>Maimony,</hi> that <hi>by the Hebrew canons they were bound to have ſchooles in every citie and in every country, as wel as ſynagogues.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, 1. you honour theſe infidel Rabbines too much, when you give vnto their writings the title of <hi>Hebrew canons,</hi> which is a name more fit and agreeable to the canonicall ſcriptures of the old Teſtament, vnto Moſes and the Prophets conteyning the

                        <hi>canon</hi> or rule of our faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, even as the greek canons may likewiſe denote the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the new Teſtament. The name of the holy ſcriptures ſhould not be given to ſuperſtitious writings, to Iewiſh fables, and to legends of lyes: And beſides, theſe Thalmudicall canons are but carnal weapons; think not with ſuch canons &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to batter downe our temples. 2. Theſe canons, are many of them the inventions of later Iewes long after Pauls times, and you can not ſhew that the Iewes in the apoſtles dayes were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by them, how then will you apply this canon alledged by you vnto the queſtion of fact betwixt vs? 3. <hi>Maimony</hi> in the

                        <hi>Arba Turim</hi> ſhewes that <hi>R. Aſher</hi> differs from Maimony in ſuch manner touching the number of ſchollers and ſchoolemaiſters to be imployed about them in ech citie, that if we were as credulous as the Iewes in regarding theſe forged canons yet could we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty therein. 5. Suppoſe there were ſuch ancient canons binding the Iewes in Epheſus to have a ſchoole among them, yet that doth not hinder but that the ſchoole of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> might be a hetheniſh ſchoole alſo. 6. If you will have the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men to be produced in theſe controverſies, are we not much more to regard the writings of learned Chriſtians, then of theſe impious Iewes, infamous as well for their fables, as for their infidelity &amp; hatred of Chriſte? And the

                     <p>Fiftly, whereas you ſay; <hi>Neither doth the School-maiſters Greek name Tyrannus hinder, but he might be a Iew, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Though I deny not but ſome Iewes had Greek names, as divers of the Apoſtles themſelves beſides ſundry others: yet conſidering that ordinarily Iewes were called by Hebrew names &amp; Greekes by Greek names, and ſo men of other nations like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if things be equally weighed <hi>[caeteris paribus,]</hi> when there is no other particular teſtimonie or determination touching any perſon to ſhew what nation he is of, as there is not here for <hi>Tyrannus:</hi> then in all reaſon the name of ſuch a man ſhould lead vs vnto ſuch a nation where his name is moſt ordinarily vſed: as the name of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> vnto an Egyptian: the name of <hi>Agag</hi> to an Amalekite: and the name of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> to a Greek.

<note n="o" place="margin">Ioſeph. Antiq.

                     <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>Daniel alſo and his brethren (who ſtrictly kept Moſes ordinances) refuſed not the learning and tongue of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, among whom Idolatrie was taught, as among other hethens.</hi> I anſwer, 1. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes might be inſtructed in the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans though they did not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the ſchooles or temples where Idolatry was publiquely taught: And ſeing
<hi>Daniel</hi> was ſo carefull to keep himſelf from pollution with vncleane meate we are bound to judge that he wanted not care to preſerve his ſoule from the vncleane foode of Idolatrous doctrines taught in their ſchooles: And the

                     <p>Fourthly, you ſay further, <hi>neither was there any ſuch converſion of this ſchoole to the ſervice of God as I me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, &amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer, 1. your reaſon to prove that it continued a ſchoole ſtill is inſufficient: for though it be ſayd that Paul diſputed dayly in the ſchoole of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> this kinde of ſpeech doth no more prove that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a ſchoole ſtill, then the ſpeech of the Apoſtle ſaying of Antichriſt that he

                     <p>Fiftly you alledge, that <hi>in ages following, Chriſtians who altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed communion with the hethens in their Idolies and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; yet vſed ſometimes the hetheniſh ſchooles: and were by Iulian the Emperour forbidden both their ſchooles and bookes; of malice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not have them learned.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, 1.

I have ſhewed before that our temples, and eſpecially that wherein we meet togather, and about which our queſtion is, doth not conſiſt of ſuch a ſuperſtitious ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and fabrick as you pretend: yea it is manifeſt in experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and manifold inſtances might be given of ſundry private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which for the ſituation and three parts before noted by you, are liker vnto Solomons temple then ours is: and conſequently to be rather deſtroyed as being idolatrous ſhrines. 3, if our temples in reſpect of their forme, proportion and parts be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments of ſuperſtition, and therfore to be avoyded; then are you as guilty in comming vnto them as we: for whether you come for your ſtudy, or whether ſome of your people come for the almes diſtributed there: the viſible ſhape and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe temples in the forme of their building doth as much preſent itſelf vnto your eyes coming thither to ſerve your ſelves: as vnto our eyes when we come thither to ſerve the Lord. The outward ſhape of the Church may as well affect &amp; enſnare him that walketh vp and downe therein for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or proffit: as him that ſitteth there to heare the word of God for his edification: ſo that if there be any weight in this pretence, it then lights vpon your owne head. 4, how know you alſo but that the heathniſh ſchooles might have a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ſtructure as well as temples: and that ſome myſticall ſignifications might be imputed or aſcribed vnto ſome parts thereof? and what then ſhall become of your diſtinction, where<pb n="271" facs="tcp:22760:149"/>by you imagine and feigne ſuch a difference betwixt our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and thoſe publique Schooles? 5. That which you ſpeak by way of compariſon with the temple touching <hi>the dwelling houſes of the Preiſts and people,</hi> is both vnequally and vnfitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto the controverſie in this place, ſeing I ſpake here of the publique places and ſchooles where the heathniſh prophets or Poets did ordinarily and openly teach idolatrie, and not of their private houſes: and beſides that, it is but a bare and falſe aſſertion which you vtter of their private houſes: ſeing they alſo may juſtly receive a denomination of the workes perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them whether good or evill.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, you obiect, <hi>if Paul, had holden it lawfull to vſe idol Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as we think we may; why took he not occaſion to go into Dianaes temple in Epheſus, as wel as into Tyrannus ſchoole there, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver, 1. there is manifeſt reaſon for this, ſeing

<note n="ſ" place="margin">Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. de ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis. cap. 8</note> vvont to do. In ſuch open places might a vveak Chriſtian in Corinth ſee many ſitting at an Idols table: yea he might alſo diſcerne &amp; ſee ſome ſitting in a temple vvithout entring into the ſame: &amp; further, if Paul had ſhevved that ſome weake Chriſtians in
<hi>Corinth</hi> had entred into the very temples, yet is not a ſimple narration of ſuch a fact, any iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, to prove that it might lavvfully be done, as you ſeeme to plead. 3. VVhere you ſay alſo,
<hi>It is not found that</hi>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:22760:150"/>
                        <hi>there or in any other citie where Paul or any other of the Apoſtles came, they ever went to preach in any ſuch place, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>yet we never ſee him to preach in any of their temples or idolies, &amp;c.</hi> This is a very vveak pretenſe, for vvhat though it be not found; and vvhat though vve never ſee it? vvill you reaſon thus nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively from the ſcripture? <hi>It is not found</hi> in the ſcriptures, in vvhat cities, nor ſo much as in vvhat countries ſome of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did preach, much leſſe in vvhat temples. Alſo it is not found in the ſcriptures that ever Paul or any other of the Apoſtles did refuſe to preach in ſuch places purged from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. 4. It is very probable, that Paul did preach in the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or Idol-place at Athens: for ſeing as I noted before, it was the manner of the heathens, to make their ſtreets and market places to be Idolies; ſeing
<hi>Athens</hi> is
<note n="t" place="margin">Pauſanias &amp; Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante Beza in Act. 17.16.</note> recorded to have far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other cities of <hi>Graecia</hi> in ſtore of Idoles and Idolatrie: ſeing Luke
<note n="u" place="margin">Act. 17.16.17.18.23.</note> records how Paul paſſing by did ſee their Altars &amp; ſuperſtition: and being ſtirred in ſpirit, did therevpon in the market dayly diſpute with whomſoever he met, as wel as in the Synagogue with the Iewes: we have therfore reaſon to think that Paul did preach Ieſus in their Idolie or market place. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes alſo that the man of God which came out of Iudah did preach in the
<note n="vv" place="margin">1. Kin. 13.1.</note> Idolie of
<hi>Bethel,</hi> (whether it was a temple or an other open place it is vncertaine,) when as he denounced the wrath of God againſt <hi>Icroboams</hi> Idolatrie. Thus <hi>Ieremie</hi> alſo
<note n="x" place="margin">Ier. 19.2. with Ier. 7.31.</note> preached in the vallie of <hi>Benhinnom,</hi> the Idolie of <hi>Moloch.</hi> And thus vpon like occaſion and like neceſſary vſe, it may ſtill be lawfull to preach in an Idol-temple in like manner, to proteſt againſt the Idolatry that is for the inſtant practiſed therein. 5. As for the teſtimony of <hi>Prudentius</hi> recording that <hi>they had as many temples of Gods in Rome, as there were ſepulchres of noble men in this citie,</hi> this makes againſt your ſelf: for if there were ſo many temples and Idolies in Roome now in <hi>Prudentius</hi> his time when he wrote this (for that which he ſaith, he affirmes for the time preſent) then this overthrowes your former allegation out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> concerning all the temples deſtroyed vnder <hi>Theodoſius</hi>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:22760:150"/>This record of <hi>Prudentius</hi> being given

<note n="z" place="margin">Lev. 11.32.33. &amp; 6 28.</note> ſcriptures vnto you, teaching that God allowes the reteyning of ſuch things as are of more proffitable vſe, though they have bene formerly polluted: The

<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 214 &amp; 250.251</note> before that the goodnes and bountifullnes of the Lorde towards his people was to be diſcerned herein: but you deſpiſe the bountifullnes of the Lord and will have his benefit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiected.<pb n="275" facs="tcp:22760:151"/>Your complaint againſt all you write againſt, is that they bring not ſcripture: but when it is brought, we ſee that you are willing enough to paſſe by it ſometimes, as if it had not bene brought at all. You ſay that touching things of neceſſary vſe, there is ynough ſayd before: but touching this new reaſon from the ſcripture, nothing was ſayd before: and that which you have ſayd before for the reſt is ſhewed to be inſufficient.

                     <p>Touching the grand Idol, erected by your ſelf, pourtrayed &amp; printed in your booke, theſe are the things which I commend vnto your conſideration, 1. You do therfore deſerve the <hi>ſorer blame</hi> to be layd vpon you, for ſetting vp this Idol, becauſe your ſelf do ſo vniuſtly labour to bring the blame of ſo hainous Idolatry vpon all the Churches of God: and you ſhould not complaine (as you do) that this thing is
<hi>aggravated</hi> againſt you, becauſe the ſight of your errour herein may be a meanes to bring you vnto ſome feeling of your ſelf and of your raſh iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. 2. Your fault hath not bene ſo aggravated againſt you, but that it may yet be ſhewed to be far greater, for though it be great in ech of the reſpects which
<note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 24.25</note> before I ſhewed, becauſe without any neceſſary vſe, you do a new erect, not a monument onely, but a very Idol, and a principall Idoll of Antichriſte, even the Idol of the croſſe, though in your anſwer you have not bene able to deny any one of theſe reſpects: yet your offence in ſetting vp this Idol is by far the more haynous and notorious in reſpect of the place, where you have ſet it. The ſettle or ſhrine wherevpon you have placed this Idol, is the name of God, even of the moſt holy Trinitie, as appeares in your printed
<note n="d" place="margin">Animad-verſ. pag. 6.</note> book, where you have affixed the idol-croſſe vnto the name of ech perſon in the Trinity, even as it is done in the idolatrous pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall: And thus you do moſt vnworthily abuſe the name of<pb n="276" facs="tcp:22760:152"/>God, in making it a foote-ſtoole for a moſt filthy idol to ſtand on and tread vpon the ſame. VVhen the hetheniſh Idols or gods that could not cary them ſelves, were
<note n="e" place="margin">Eſa. 46.1.2.</note> caryed vpon the bunches of the camelles or vpon the backs of other beaſts that bowed and fell downe vnder the burden, it was folly to be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed at and ſin to be condemned; but to ſet the moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idol vpon the back of the moſt holy and pure God; this is a ſin of greater indignity, to be abhorred and trembled at. It is odious to ſee the pope that great beaſt caried vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhoulders of men; but that the popes Idol croſſe ſhould ride vpon the ſhoulders of the holy Trinitie, as in a chariot of Triumph, as in your book you have made it, this is far more odious and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. The ſin of
<hi>Solomon</hi> was greater in reſpect of the place where he ſet vp Idols, even
<note n="f" place="margin">1. Kin. 11 7.</note> in the
<hi>mountaine that is over againſt Ieruſalem:</hi> The ſin of
<hi>Manaſses</hi> was yet greater in reſpect of the place where he ſet vp Idols, even

                        <hi>Beelzebub Prince of the Devilles,</hi> &amp; yet place it over the ark, even vpon the Glorious and fearful name of the Holy Trinitie: You that ſo raſhly blame all the Churches of Chriſt for their vſe of temples formerly polluted vvith Idolatrie, have not feared to make the name of God an Idol-temple, vvhere to this day the Idol-ſtands ſtill: vvere your bookes as much vvorth as the Epheſians Act 19. you ſhould do vvell to burne them all, that are yet in your hands, for a teſtimonie of your repentance. And for ſo much as you have condemned the Church of Rome, for imprinting the very ſame Idol of the croſſe not onely in their Churches and houſes, but alſo
<note n="i" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>in their bookes and writings;</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh your ovvne book and vvriting vvherein you have cauſed<pb n="277" facs="tcp:22760:152"/>it to be imprinted. 3, whereas you plead, <hi>the most that I can truely ſay, is that you ſeek to pull them downe from religious vſe after an vnlawfull maner, &amp;c.</hi> I am indeed willing to judge the beſt of you, and think that your entent and meaning was to doe God good ſervice, (as I wrote before) in <hi>teaching men the evill of</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. But the beſt that we can judge hereof is evill enough: we ſee many Authors of playes and comedies do ſet forth ſuch enterludes with intent to pluck downe vice, but doing the ſame without any warrant of Gods word, &amp; vſing ſuch a kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as God never appoynted: they do ſtrengthen the vices &amp; wickednes which they would reprove. And what is the maine breach of the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but the ſerving of God
<hi>after an vnlawful maner?</hi> Therfore when you ſee yourſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>victed of this <hi>vnlawfull maner</hi> by ſetting vp an Idol, &amp; making the name of God an Idolie for the ſame, your evill therein may be great enough though there be no more then that. 4, In ſetting downe your anſwer to my reaſon againſt your Idol, you deale deceitfully, and vſe a fallacie <hi>ab iniquâ diviſione,</hi> dividing that reaſon in to two, which was but one. The ſumme of it was: that ſuch kinde of inſtruction as did occaſion men to ſtumble, to bleſſe an Idol in their hearts, and to worſhip the ſame, and withall was a deviſed kinde of inſtruction without warrant of Gods word, that was vnlawfull. The latter part of this reaſon I ſet downe by way of preoccupacion, to prevent thoſe vaine anſwers, which yet you have made vnto it: as may be ſeene in my
<note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> former writing, This reaſon being taken thus together, your anſwers do both vaniſh preſently: for that which you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt of men being offended and brought to bleſs an Idol, <hi>by ſeing or hearing the name of a croſſe or crucifix,</hi> is cut of by the ſecond part of my reaſon: becauſe there is warrant in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to write or pronounce the name of an Idol, but not to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture them for religious vſe, as you have done the croſſe: That which you anſwer in the ſecond place touching <hi>the tabernacle, ark, temple, and ſuch like things deſcribed in mappes,</hi> is cut of by the firſt part of my reaſon: becauſe theſe figures and deſcriptions
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:22760:153"/>are not Idolatrous and ſcandalous as is the paynting of Idols &amp; images for religious vſe. That you may more plainely ſee how vnequally and vnreaſonably you match theſe things together, which are ſo vnlike: do but conſider, that in the deſcription of carnall adultery &amp; vncleannes, it would be a ſinfull and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to picture many ſtories in ſuch maner, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have bene done in the ſcriptures: as for example, to paynt <hi>Bathſheba</hi> as ſhe was
<note n="l" place="margin">2. Sam. 11 2.4.</note> ſeene of David, &amp; defiled of <hi>David,</hi> to pourtray the images of

                        <hi>Amnon</hi> &amp; <hi>Thamar,</hi> &amp; of divers others as they are deſcribed in the word of God. You acknowledge, I doubt not but that their ſin is great which make ſuch offenſive pictures,
<note n="o" place="margin">Ezek. 23.14.16.</note> occaſions of luſt. And if the naked pictures of carnall adultereſſes be vnlawfull, then are the pictures of ſpirituall whoredom in the caſe of offence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull alſo. And who ſees not the great difference betwixt theſe vncleane ſcandalous pictures, and the mappes of countries or figures of the temple and ſuch like things as you ſpeake of? 5, of the 7. reaſons which you bring againſt our vſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though they be all inſufficient againſt vs: yet there are 5. of them that do condemne this vnneceſſary vſe of the Idol-croſſe erected in your booke; namely, the firſt, ſecond, fift, ſixt and ſeventh which ſerve to reprove the Idols and monuments of Idolatry, whereof there is no proffit to the Church of God. 6, whereas you ſeek to diminiſh your fault, by aſking whether it be not

<hi>private?</hi> And yet if your bookes were private onely for your owne houſe, yet to
<note n="p" place="margin">Deut. 27.15.</note> ſet vp an Idol in them in ſecret, is not free: The
<note n="q" place="margin">Ibid. c. 13 6.</note> ſecret entiſer vnto Idolatry is ſubiect vnto judgement. 7. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:22760:153"/>you ſay concerning this Idol, that you will <hi>leave it to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; ſtrive no more:</hi> and confeſſe alſo that you
<hi>may ſin in this matter though you ſee it not:</hi> you do hereby ſhew ſome doubting and vncertainty in this queſtion. It is alſo ſome ſigne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in you, in that here
<note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 175.</note> before having as much or more colour to paynt croſſes in ſhewing the maner of conſecrating Churches out of the pontifical, then in ſhewing the maner of popiſh ordination, yet have you now (after admonition and warning) abſtayned from making theſe Idols. But as yourſelf ſayd before, <hi>The abſteyning from the practiſe doth not clear the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> vnleſs you do further repent and renounce your ſin: yea if
<note n="s" place="margin">Pag. 82.</note> your reaſoning againſt vs were ſound, your miniſtery ſhould be vnlawfull and not to be communicated withall vntill you had repented for making this Idol. If therfore you ſee not your ſin herein, as you ſay, you ought not to reſt, but rather to deſire to heare more of this queſtion in ſpeciall, that your conſcience might be ſettled and you come to ſome reſolution. But as for your ceaſſing to ſtrive vpon that pretence becauſe I ſpake of ſome that had done this before you and of following a few herein, neglecting the examples of others, &amp;c. this is very vaine: if vpon ſuch pretences men ſhould ceaſs to ſtrive for the truth, you may ſee that many moſt neceſſary controverſies would be cut of, and the truth not mainteyned as is meet. Laſtly, I do not juſtify our evill by your doing the like, as you warne me not to plead: but I labour to condemne your evill, your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an Idol without cauſe: if this were like vnto our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I ſhould condemne my ſelf alſo: And I ſhew your fault herein to this end, that you ſeing your errour touching the nature of Idols and Idolatry, might learne to be more ſober, &amp; more ſwift to heare and ſlow to ſpeak againſt the Church of God, and more ſlow to wrath in plucking downe our temples over our heads, vnleſs you could better ſhew the wrath of God againſt them.</p>

Ioh. 5. Rev. 18. and that the deſtruction of Idols and idolies is a moral and perpetual precept, not figurative or temporarie. And your exception of neceſſarie vſe, I have diſproved: ſhewing that for deteſtation of idols, God commanded and his people performed the demoliſhing of them, Exod. 34. Deut. 7. Ezek. 23. Gen. 35. Both theſe are confirmed by the firſt ſcripture in our reaſon here alledged. For in Eſai 30.22, the coverings and ornaments of idols are propheſied to be cast away with deteſtation: yet who knoweth not that of them there might be a neceſsarie vſe to men? wherevpon a promiſe of bleſsing foloweth, v. 23, &amp;c.

The caſting away of the coverings there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is expreſſely noted and declared in the text, to be as the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting away of a ſtained garment,</hi> which was caſt away, onely du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtaine vpon it, but being waſhed with water might lawfully be vſed againe; neither did God ever command otherwiſe in his law: And ſo this place is againſt your ſelf, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that our temples being purged may yet be reteyned. 2, what compariſon is there betwixt the clothing and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of an Idol and our temples, but even ſuch as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the
<note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 11.33 &amp; 15.12.</note> earthen and the woodden veſſel, whereof one was to be broken and caſt away, the other to be waſhed and reteyned for the proffit of Gods people? 3. The covering and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<pb n="282" facs="tcp:22760:156"/>of an Idol is of no neceſſarie vſe in the ſervice of God, but the circumſtance of place is neceſſarily required to meet in: and our temples ſerving conveniently for ſuch purpoſe may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reteyned, rather then the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Idols.
4. Though this propheſie do reſpect the dayes of the Goſpell as you ſhew from <hi>Eſa. 30.25.26, &amp;c.</hi> Yet is it to be vnderſtood and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the determination of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the new Teſtament, which ſhew vs a lawfull vſe of every creature of God for the neceſſary help of his people. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without this caveat men might ſtill reteyne the whole ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law: ſeing there are ſo many prophecies reſpecting the dayes of the Goſpell, which yet tell vs of
<note n="u" place="margin">Eſa. 19.19.21.</note> Altars, of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and oblation, of
<note n="vv" place="margin">Mal. 1.11</note> incenſe, of
<note n="x" place="margin">Zach. 14.16.17.</note> going vp to Ieruſalem to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles, of
<note n="y" place="margin">Ezek. 40. chap. &amp;c.</note> building a new temple with ceremoniall obſervations therein, &amp;c. All theſe propheſies reſpect the new Teſtament, deſcribing a ſpirituall worſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der carnall rites and ſhadowes of the law: ſo that though Eſay had ſpoken in this place more ceremonially in the deſcription of our eſtate, then he had done: yet the determinations which I have before ſhewed cut of the new Teſtament, muſt be our rule and guide to expound the ſame: and being ſo expounded your cauſe is not holpen thereby. 5, as for
<hi>Eſay. 31.7. &amp; Deut. 9.21.</hi> they ſpeak not of places abuſed vnto Idolatry, but of Idols themſelves, ſuch as you cannot prove our temples to be: And beſides this, even Gods owne ordinances in the abuſe thereof are called
<note n="z" place="margin">Eſa. 1.13</note> 
                     <hi>a ſyn</hi> or iniquitie: and therfore this phraſe proves not an vtter abolition of things ſo called, being attributed and given vnto ſuch things as after the purging thereof may and ought to be reteyned. Againe as for the deſtruction of the Calfe in Deut. 9. it was extraordinary, neither were men bound ſtrictly to follow the ſame maner of ſhewing deteſtation againſt idols, no not vnder the law itſelf. Your boaſting in concluſion, that our
<hi>exceptions are but pretexts, that your reaſons remaine in their force for the ruinating of all idolies, &amp;c.</hi> is like vnto a pleaſant dreame, wherein you fancie and imagine that which you faine<pb n="283" facs="tcp:22760:156"/>would have: but you may not ſit downe in the throne to judge of your owne diſpute: ſtand vp at the bar and let others judge whether all your ſhot and ordinance have bene able to batter downe our temples: and whether your ſchiſme rather be not neere vnto ruine, which for ſuch pretexts of Idol-temples do ſeparate from all true Chriſtians.</p>

VVe ſuppoſe you have no great conſcience of your owne profeſſion, and therfore can not ſo eaſily be drawne to receive your doctrines without further examination of them by the word of God: Herein we are much holpen and kept from ioyning raſhly vnto you.

As truth deſtroyes errour, ſo doth one errour deſtroy another ſometimes, and one practiſe refute an other and therfore though the holy ſcriptures onely can ſhew the truth of religion, yet erroneous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory practiſes are alſo a meanes to condemne falſhood &amp; ſtop the mouth of thoſe that maintaine ſuch errours. To this end and not further do we alledge your practiſe: far be it from vs, that we ſhould make your wayes a rule of religion.</p>
                     <p>But now to come vnto the obiection itſelf, I ſeek your anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer here in the proper place, but finde it not, as I expected: In ſtead hereof you ſend me back vnto the defenſe of your ſixt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therein a corner you would hide your head from the<pb n="285" facs="tcp:22760:157"/>force of this reproofe, but you muſt be brought forth into the light againe: for 1, howſoever you ſay of this Iewes ſynagogue, which you vſed to aſſemble in, that <hi>you have before proved, that it is not, nor ever was an Idolie:</hi> that have I already reproved and refuted againe: That defenſe of your ſixt reaſon being ſhewed to be vaine. 2. The obiection which I made againſt your ſixt reaſon, did concerne private houſes of Idolatours, as of Papiſts, Moſchovites and ſuch like: but this ſynagogue of the Iewes was not a private place, but a place of publique worſhip where many families of the Iewes did ordinarily meete together in a ſolemne congregation; &amp; ſo alſo hath your ſeparate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany done as publiquely and ſolemnely after the Iewes had left it. And therfore thoſe private houſes and this publique ſynagogue are moſt vnequally and vniuſtly matched together, neither can the anſwer of that place be applyed vnto this. 3, you made exception for the private houſes mentioned in the former place that they were <hi>civil houſes,</hi> but the ſynagogue of the Iewes whereof I ſpeak, being for the publique worſhip of God may be called a religious place as well as any other. And though ſome perſons dwelt in ſome part of it, that hinders not but that it was to be eſteemed a religious houſe or ſynagogue: you ſee the moſt of the temples in this citie, have divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dwelling in ſeverall parts of them, which yet you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne as Idolies: If you were not partiall you would conſider this: for the excuſe of our temples, as well as of the Iewes. The Iewes

And if they had not old houſes enough convenient for their purpoſe, they might make new, provided that they made ſome roomes above or belovv for their Prieſts and other perſons to dvvell in, and then if any
<hi>Iehu</hi> or <hi>Ioſias</hi> came to pluck dovvne thoſe Idolies of Chemoſh, Baal or Dagon, they might plead againſt them that thoſe places were civil houſes, and dvvelling houſes of men, though publique vvorſhip vvere ordinarily performed in them, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Kings had no authority to demoliſh them: and thus had they had ſome of your ſubtile ſhifts they might have coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the lavv, deluded the godly Kings and preſerved their Idol-temples from deſtruction.</p>

And if a King ſalute him, as he is writing that name, he may not anſwer him. And when he hath dipt his pen into the ynke to write the name of God, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him immediately to begin with the name of God leaſt there ſhould bee too much ynke in the pen, but for a praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he muſt firſt begin to write the word that comes before the name of God, with that new penfull of ynke. If he write any of the names of God in gold, it is vnlawful: And a number of other ſuperſtitious traditions they have about the meaſures of the booke, the forme of the letters, the ſections open and ſhut, the diſtances betwixt book and book, ſection and ſection, line &amp; line; about the correction of literal faults, and the toleration of them: about the ruling of the book, the ſowing of the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the ſinowes of cleane beaſts, &amp;c. But when it is made, then they

He that travelles from place to place and hath the book of the law with him, may not put it in a ſack, nor lay it vpon the back of the aſſe whereon he rides, but he muſt put it in his boſome, over againſt his heart. They may not ſit vpon that bed, where this booke is layd: They may not touch this book, but through a vayle, wherewith it muſt firſt be covered: They may not bring it into many places: And that houſe where it is, may not be vſed as before it was. VVhen it is worne out, or made vnmeet for vſe, they muſt put it into an earthen veſſell, and ſo bury it: and this, nere vnto one of their wiſe diſciples or Rabbines. They diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this book of the law, and the pentateuch, or 5. bookes of Moſes, in reſpect of this forme and maner of writing, though<pb n="296" facs="tcp:22760:163"/>the ſame words be conteyned in both: Though they may lay this book vpon the back of an other book of the law, and the pentateuch vpon the Prophets, and Pſalmes, &amp;c. yet they may not lay the Prophets and pſalmes vpon the back of the penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, nor the pentateuch vpon the back of this book of the law: ſuch ſuperſtitious differences and degrees of holynes do they forge vnto themſelves.

Herein they commit heynous Idolatrie, by aſcribing vnto <hi>Elias</hi> a divine power and propertie as though he could be preſent in many places at once wherſoever circumciſion is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: As the Papiſts offend by mainteyning the body of Chriſt to be preſent in their maſſe wherſoever it is celebrated; ſo do the Iewes by mainteyning the body of <hi>Elias</hi> to be preſent in their Idol circumciſion vvherſoever it is adminiſtred by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, honouring his preſence alſo by ſetting a chaire or throne for him, &amp;c.

If thus you think, I pray you tell me in your next. Secondly, you ſay not wel nor rightly, that this is not the</hi> releef of a citie, <hi>(as we oppoſe Citie or political eſtate, to Church or Eccleſiaſtical eſtate) For 1. the Magiſtrats of the citie, are not neceſsarily of the Church, but onely ſuch as will. 2. This collection is not by the appointment of the Church (who have an eccleſiastical collection by their Deacons,) but by the appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Magistrate. 3. They collect it not from the Church onely in their congregation, but from all the citie alſo, by every ſtreet and houſe, of all the inhabitants that wil give: of which not one among many, are members of the Church. 4. They collect it not for the Church, but for the citie: and ſo for the poore of the Church, not conſidered as members of the Church, but as members of the common wealth. 5. The diſtributors appointed by the Magiſtrates, are not neceſſarily members, much leſſe Deacons of the Church. 6. And they to whom it is diſtributed, are the poore of all ſorts, not in reſpect as they are members of any Church: but as they are poore and dwelt for a time in the citie.

                     <note place="margin">Io. Pa.</note> TO convince you of partialitie in condemning our vſe of temples, I alledged your own vſe of the ſame, while your poore do alſo publiquely worſhip God in the ſame temples, if they do but publiquely bleſſe them in the name of God, of whom they do publiquely receive thoſe almes in ſuch places. And here I
<note n="a" place="margin">See before pag. 27.</note> refuted three diſtinctions which you vſe to excuſe your ſelves in this matter. I ſhewed the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of your firſt diſtinction, in that you made the receyving of the almes in this place to be <hi>occaſional,</hi> and the worſhip of the Church to be <hi>ordinary,</hi> &amp;c. Now you anſwer, that
<hi>the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique worſhip of the Church is eccleſiaſtical, the almes here ſpoken of, is political &amp; civil, &amp;c.</hi> And herevnto I reply. 1. I do not herein ſo much blame your manifeſt errour &amp; ignorance, your want of judgement in the diſtinction as you made it at firſt, as I do now blame your want of vpright and honeſt dealing in changing and altering the diſtinction, in putting <hi>political and civil</hi> in ſtead of
<hi>occaſional:</hi> As there is a plaine difference betwixt betwixt Eccleſiaſticall and political, ſo is there alſo betvvixt
<hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall</hi> &amp; <hi>occaſional:</hi> for many things are political which are not occaſional, but ordinary: let all men of knowledge, be judges.
2, vvhereas you ſay that <hi>people of all religion or of no religion</hi> do receive this almes, this doth not excuſe the falſ hood of your firſt diſtinction in making the almes to be <hi>occaſional:</hi> for even atheiſts or heretiques or ſchiſmatiques that never go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heare the word of God, may yet obſerve an ordinary &amp; ſet time of the almes, and be willing to receive the ſame in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique &amp; ſolemne maner &amp; not onely occaſionally. 3. Though it were very groſſe, if you ſhould plainely affirme that this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes here ſpoken of was occaſional; yet to colour the matter a little you vſe an abſurd phraſe which might inſinuate as much vnto the ſimple, in ſaying of the poore that <hi>vpon occaſion of the almes there given,</hi> they go thither to receive it, &amp;c. for you might as wel ſay touching the publique ordinary worſhip of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:22760:170"/>the Church, that <hi>vpon occaſion of the word preached</hi> the godly go to heare, &amp;c. And where then is your difference betwixt <hi>occaſionall and ordinary?</hi> 4, I will make even your ſelf judge of the matter: for when you ſpeak without preiudice &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then you do rightly interpret this word <hi>occaſional,</hi> and do expound
<note n="b" place="margin">Annot. on Exo. 21.13.</note>

                  <p>In the refutation of your ſecond diſtinction, the firſt thing which I
<note n="c" place="margin">See before pag. 27.</note> noted in oppoſition therevnto was, that <hi>not onely the benevolence given to the miniſters or Saints of Chriſte, but that alſo which is given to the poore of any religion whatſoever, one or other, is a ſervice and</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 13.16 Gal. 6 10. 2. Cor.
9.13</note> 
                     <hi>ſacrifice of ſweet odour, &amp;c.</hi> And what have you ſayd herevnto? 1, in repeating my reply, you leave out thoſe words <hi>not onely,</hi> which ſhewed the very poynt wherein I oppoſed your anſwer, and ſay nothing at all vnto it: but ſmoothly paſſe it over without any defence: I deſire the reader to obſerve your cunning therein. 2, In ſtead of anſwering that which was plainely ſet downe, you make enquirie about a deviſed thing <hi>ſeeming</hi> ſo vnto you which is not ſet downe nor meant at all: you aſk me whether I think that if any of our people for their neceſſitie ſhould receive private almes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or other heretiques they ſhould not receive a civil bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence but an eccleſiaſticall, &amp;c. VVherevnto I anſwer that I do not thinke they ſhould receive an eccleſiaſticall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: yea further if our people ſhould privately joyne with ſuch in prayer vnto God, yet would I not account this an eccleſiaſticall communion or action. And though the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I cited may be applyed to private benevolence alſo and not publique onely: yet doth not the citing of them imply that I think private benevole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be an eccleſiaſticall matter. what meane you to runne away from queſtion by ſuch vaine ſhifts?</p>

                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:22760:171"/>The other thing which I noted in oppoſition to your ſecond diſtinction, was: that <hi>this almes we ſpeak of is not the releefe of a citie, but cheefely the benevolence of a Church, &amp;c.</hi> Herevnto you reply that I ſay <hi>not well nor rightly,</hi> &amp;c. Your reaſons are divers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you ſay, <hi>the Magiſtrates of the citie are not neceſſarily of the Church, but onely ſuch as will.</hi> I anſwer, 1. This hinders not but the almes ſpoken of may be cheefely the benevolence of a Church: even as other actions may be actions of the church, though the Magiſtrates be not of the Church. Shew I pray you, how this your propoſition may be applyed againſt my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> vvhat if the Magiſtrates here were all neceſſarily of the Church ſhould this make the almes to be then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the Church? ſhould this either further or hinder the thing in queſtion? your looſe allegation can no way be applyed vnto this matter, either one way or other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay, <hi>this collection is not by the appointment of the Church (who have an other eccleſiaſticall collection by their deacons) but by the appointment of the Magiſtrate.</hi> I anſwer, that there be many eccleſiaſticall actions, which are done by the appoyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Magiſtrate, as the holding of an eccleſiaſticall Synod: the obſervation of ſolemne and religious faſts not by the appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church but of the Magiſtrate: yea the ordinary worſhip of God in preaching the word and other ſervices here are and
<note n="e" place="margin">2. Chro. 8.14. &amp; 14.4.</note> ought to be commanded by the Magiſtrates: And now according to your vnſound reaſoning theſe and ſuch like actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould not be eccleſiaſticall. You ought to have conſidered that as in theſe ſo in the almes ſpoken of, becauſe they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred publiquely of the Church and at the exhortation of the miniſters going with the ſame, they may therfore be called the benevolence of a Church, though appoynted by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you plead that <hi>they collect it not from the Church onely in their congregation, but from all the citie alſo, by every ſtreet and houſe,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. In that this almes is ordinarily and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:22760:171"/>publiquely gathered every Lords day in the congregation, and that the greateſt part thereof is collected in this ſolemne maner in the Church, the other collection in the ſtreets being but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in compariſon of this; this is enough to confirme as much as I affirme, namely that this almes is <hi>not the releefe of a citie but cheefely the benevolence of a Church, &amp;c.</hi> All reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that ech thing ſhould receive denomination of that which is principall and cheef therein. 2, even that which the deacons diſtribute is by them collected for a great part the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, of ſuch as are no members of the Church: and this not onely in reſpect of the ſtrangers which come into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, but alſo privately collected from ſuch as dayly get ſome thing into the poore mans box vpon occaſion of bargia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with whoſoever. And thus according to your reaſoning that which the deacons diſtribute ſhould be the releef of a citie, &amp; not cheefely the benevolence of a Church, becauſe they do not collect it from the church onely in their congregation, &amp;c. 3, even that almes which is collected in your owne Church, is not from the members of your Church onely: but though an 100, ſtrangers, infidelles in your account, come into your congregation and ſhould publiquely contribute with the reſt into your Church treaſure, though it was heretofore
<note n="f" place="margin">Refut of Giff. p 147.</note> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by H. Barow) yet do you now accept and allow the ſame. If this almes thus receyved among you be eccleſiaſticall, then have you no reaſon to deny this other almes we ſpeak of, to be the benevolence of a Church, in reſpect of the perſons from whom it is collected.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you argue, that <hi>they collect it not for the Church, but for the citie: and ſo for the poore, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that it may be an Eccleſiaſtical almes if it be collected of the Church, though not for the Church. As thoſe prayers which are publiquely made by the Church
<note n="g" place="margin">Ezr. 6.10. Ier. 29.7. Mat. 5.44. 1. Tim. 2.1.2.</note> for ſtrangers, and for ſuch as are no members of the Church, are to be accounted an Eccleſiaſticall ſervice, and a worſhip of the Church, though they be made not for the Church, but for the citie, for frendes or enimies without: even<pb n="314" facs="tcp:22760:172"/>ſo the almes collected of the Church in a ſolemne aſſembly on the Lords day, and given as a part of their publique ſervice vnto God, are to be eſteemed a benevolence of the Church or a Church-ſervice, though they be collected for ſuch as are in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, though not of the Church; ſeing the Churches (as well as private perſons) are
<note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 58.7. Neh. 5.5. Heb. 13.2.3 1 Theſ. 4.12.</note> bound to ſhew mercy vnto them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, you argue that <hi>the diſtributors appoynted by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats, are not neceſsarily members, much leſse deacons of the Church.</hi> But where is the proofe of this conſequence, that therfore this almes is not an Eccleſiaſticall benevolence? If your Church ſhould agree together publiquely to collect in your congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and then to ſend the ſame almes vnto any in affliction, and not by any deacons or members of your Church but by ſome other honeſt and truſty perſons without; ſhould this almes now ceaſſe to be a Church ſervice, or an Eccleſiaſticall bevevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? VVhat colour of reaſon can you bring for this?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, you ſay, <hi>they to whom it is distributed, are the poore of all ſorts, not in reſpect as they are members of any Church, but as they are poore and have dwelt for a time in the citie.</hi> Anſ. This reaſon is the ſame in effect with the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that went before, and an idle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame, and is before anſwered. And now I do willingly agree with you in this that all who know what poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and eccleſiaſtical meaneth, judge betweene you and vs of what nature this benevolence is, and whether it be not as I ſayd cheefly the benevolence of a Church, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe I ſhould grant you, that this almes were merely civill, and not the benevolence of a Church, yet this doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing weaken our maine obiection againſt you: for 1. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be eccleſiaſticall or civill, if your people do publiquely in the name of God bleſſe thoſe that ſo mercifully diſtribute vnto them in an Idol-temple as you account it; then muſt you nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des acknowledge, that there is a lawfull worſhipping of God in an Idol-temple, which yet you condemne in all other churches of God. 2, you cannot deny but that this diſtribution of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:22760:172"/>almes which your people do receive in this temple, is a ſolemne publique action performed for the glory and ſervice of God by them that adminiſter: And do you then hold it more lawfull to communicate with ſuch almoners as yourſelf note to be ſometimes no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church, then to joyne in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God with a true Church in the ſame place? If it were an eccleſiaſticall action of the deacons of the reformed dutch Church, diſtributing out of their Church treaſurie as they do vnto the members of their owne Church, would you then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the members of your Church for receiving the ſame of them? 3. By your doctrine this temple where your poore receive this almes, ought to be ruinated, either burnt or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe broken downe, and ſo in your judgement is vnlawfully reteyned even for this vſe of diſtributing to the poore therein: Now if notwithſtanding this vnlawfull reteyning hereof you can yet joyne with others in vſing this place to ſuch purpoſe of diſtributing almes therein as it ought not to be employed vnto: why can you not as well joyne with others in the other vſe of hearing Gods word therein? The
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 12.23.</note> legal commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of deſtroying Idol-temples, doth as wel aboliſh them from being almes houſes as from being houſes of prayer. And where then is your diſpenſation to vſe them for receiving of almes, rather then for receyving of ſpirituall inſtructions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? If you plead that your vſe of them is onely a civil vſe, ſo as meates ſacrificed to Idols were to be reteyned: This cannot help you, becauſe

Cor. 10.25.</note> things ſacrificed to Idols need not to be burnt and aboliſhed, but by your doctrine our temples ſhould be aboliſhed, and deſtroyed, and ſo conſequently made vnfit to meet or aſſemble in even for civil vſes. A waken your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth, and examine yourſelf, whether you be not guilty of partialitie, in theſe your contrary doctrines and practiſes, which cannot agree one with an other. And thinke that God knockes at the dore of your conſcience by theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions: and deſpiſe not the counſell that is given vnto you in his name.</p>

                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:22760:173"/>As for your third diſtinction,
<hi>between the ſolemne appoynted worſhip of God by the Church, and the private dueties of thankfulnes ſalutation, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhevved that
<hi>this diſtinction alſo could not truely be applyed vnto the matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the dueties of godly thankfulnes and bleſsing which are and ought to be here performed, are not private dueties but publique even as is this almes that is alwayes publiquely adminiſtred in the preſence of a great multitude aſſembled together.</hi> Herevnto you anſvver againe that <hi>by this plea, I would ſeem to prove an Eccleſiaſticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in publique prayer, which the dutch Church of this citie ſhould have with all the poore in the towne, even the moſt irreligious, profane and heretical, &amp;c.</hi> But for reply vnto this. 1. I obſerve how you againe leaving that which is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely ſet downe, do faine matter for yourſelf to anſwer, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a ſemblance, a <hi>ſeeming</hi> vnto you, which can by no meanes be juſtly collected from my words. For though I ſayd, the poore do bleſſe publiquely in the name of the Lord thoſe that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto them, yet doth not this prove a communion in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique prayer which the dutch church ſhould have with all ſuch. 2, though I had ſayd much more: if I had ſayd that the dutch Church had bene all preſent: that this almes had bene given by their deacons in their name: that there had bene ſolemne prayer conceived by the deacons at the delivery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: that all the poore had ſayd Amen vnto it and againe bleſſed them publiquely in the name of the Lord, yet would not this inferre ſuch an eccleſiaſticall communion of the dutch Church with the profane &amp; heretical poore, as you accuſe me for going about to prove. Are not many irreligious, idolatrous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane people oftentimes preſent at your eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies hearing your ſermons, and ſaying Amen vnto your prayers: &amp; doth this prove an eccleſiaſticall communion of your Church withall thoſe profane perſons that receive inſtruction from you? where then is your ſeparation? But if all this do not prove that you hold communion with ſuch perſons: then much leſſe doth that which I ſayd prove ſuch a communion of the Dutch Church with the profane, as you would draw from my words.<pb n="317" facs="tcp:22760:173"/>3, neither do I mention this receyving of almes <hi>to diſgrace your poore,</hi> as you mention it, but to reprove your partialitie, who ſeeking to diſgrace and condemne all the Churches of Chriſt for the vſe of their temples, do yet for your proffit allow your poore to vſe the very ſame temples in receyving of almes.</p>
                  <p>You ſay further, that I <hi>manifeſtly turne from the matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for I deny not the difference which you put, neither in truth can.</hi> But I pray you, is that to turne from the queſtion, when I ſhewed that the difference or diſtinction which you brought <hi>could not be truely applyed to this matter in hand?</hi> And what though your difference alledged by you be true in itſelf: is it not reproofe &amp; ſhame enough vnto you that it cannot be truely applyed vnto the preſent controverſie? Is not the miſapplication of a true diſtinction vnſound dealing, and an abuſing of the reader? Though I deny not a difference betwixt ſolemne appoynted worſhip, and the private dueties of thankfulnes, ſalutation, &amp;c. yet I deny that the bleſſing in the name of God whereof I ſpoke is any private thankfulnes or ſalutation: and what proffit can you then here make of this your diſtinction?</p>
                  <p>But you proceed and ſay, <hi>As for any publique bleſsing, it is knowne that the Magiſtrates deputies performe this buſines, without any publick prayer or bleſsing, either before or after.</hi> I anſwer, 1, it is enough, for proofe of that I ſayd, if the people receyving the almes do pray or bleſſe in the name of God, thoſe that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto them: if your poore do ſo much at the receit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then do they openly and publiquely worſhip God in the place, which you account an Idol-temple. 2, as for the diſtributours of this almes, there is the leſſe need for them to make any publique prayer, becauſe they begin there diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſtantly and immediately after the ſermon is ended, and after the publique prayers of the miniſter and the Church: which prayers being in the ſame place may alſo ſerve for the ſanctification of the almes then diſtributed. And may not the conſciences of your people be touched and ſmitten in them ſelves to conſider how they ſtay out of the Church till all the<pb n="318" facs="tcp:22760:174"/>ſpirituall almes of inſtruction for the ſoule be diſtributed and ended, and then to come into the ſame place immediately, juſt when the corporall almes is to be reached forth vnto them?
3. The publique collection and giving of almes even in your owne Church after your ſermon, is performed without any publique prayer or bleſsing made by your deacons, as is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed vnto me: doth it therfore ceaſs to be an eccleſiaſticall and ſolemne part of Gods worſhip?</p>
                  <p>You ſay moreover, that <hi>neither do they require of all or any of the people any prayer or bleſsing publique or private.</hi> And what though the almoners require it not? yet as I ſhewed you
<note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from divers
<note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 4.19.20. 2. Tim. 1.16. 2. Cor.

                  <p>Againe you adde: <hi>Neither do the people performe it otherwiſe then by thankfull obeyſance of ech one that receyveth it, &amp;c.</hi> But this you ſay, is not true for all that receyve it: for there are ſome which vpon the receit do ſtraightway open their mouthes and pray for a bleſsing and reward vnto thoſe that give this almes vnto them: And ſo ought your people to do according to thoſe ſhort formes of prayer vſed in the ſcripture,
<note n="n" place="margin">pſ. 129.8. Ruth. 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>The bleſsing of the Lord be vpon you:</hi> or <hi>we bleſſe you in the name of the Lord:</hi> And beſides, I propounded this obiection at firſt by way of ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaying, if you will allow your people to bleſſe them in the name of the Lord, &amp;c.

                  <p>Touching your reply made vnto the anſwer vvhich I gave vnto your queſtion about vvalking vp and dovvne in Idol-temples I do obſerve further.</p>

For the firſt, you ſeeme to allow my choiſe, that we hold onely vnto the maine cauſes of your ſeparation, &amp;c. but I ſpake not of the <hi>maine</hi> cauſes, but of the
<hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of your ſeparation, whether great or ſmall; ſo that you leave the matter in ſome vncertainty ſtill, not ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing me which and how many you hold for <hi>iust</hi> cauſes, when I had nominated ſundry differences betwixt vs. You ſay, <hi>you ſet downe an argument for your ſeparation fortifyed vvith many ſcriptures, &amp;c.</hi> And I have ſhewed the contents of your maine argument, to be beſide the queſtion of our Church: and there is no place of ſcripture which I can diſcerne to be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt our eſtate in particular, but I have given anſwer therevnto. And for our particular congregation, though you were never of it, yet may we juſtly ſay that you have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the communion thereof, and not onely as we agree with England but as we agree with theſe Churches: for you that had ſeparated yourſelf from all the true Churches long before this our particular Church was gathered; and you that do ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and refuſe the worſhip of God in ſuch temples as we vſe, (if there were nothing els) do thereby renounce commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with vs in our ordinary worſhip of God. That we have juſt cauſe to diſclaime your ſeparation as a ſchiſme, I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſhew in ſome part in this treatiſe, and will endevour <pb n="329" facs="tcp:22760:180"/>make it yet more plaine, as the Lord ſhall give ſtrength and opportunitie. And if there were nothing els, your allegation of this ſcripture <hi>Heb. 6.1.</hi> might ſhew vs your ſchiſme: vvhen having ſpoken of our ſtanding one with England; of your owne repentance for it; of our ſins remayning vpon vs, &amp;c. you ſay,
<hi>how can vve give you the right hand of fellowſhip, ſeing repentance from dead vvorkes, is one of the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt?</hi> The ſubſtance of this obiection hath bene twiſe largely
<note n="f" place="margin">Chap. 4. &amp; 6.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before: yet ſince you repeat it againe, I do againe tell you, 1. If it were granted that our communion with Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d were a ſin, yet might we have true repentance though we could not ſee the ſame to acknowledge it. Your contrary plea ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the errour of the perfectioniſts and enclines to fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme: for if true repentance cannot be without the knowledge of every particular ſin, then do you teach a perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge contrary to the
<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor 8.2 &amp; 13.9.</note> ſcriptures: If true repentance may be had without the knowledge of of ech particular ſin, then why not without the knowledge of this ſin as well as of others? The Apoſtle ſhewes that <hi>repentance from dead vvorkes</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> is neceſſary to ſalvation, but he doth not deny that to be true repentance, where there is ignorance of ſome particular dead works that are in vs: this holy ſcripture is therfore abuſed by you. 2, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we vvere vvithout true repentance, yet vvhere is the ſcripture, that ſhevves our Church ought therfore to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from? The ſin of ſome doth not pollute the reſt vvhich approve not thereof. 3, whereas in my ſecond anſwer
<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I noted as great differences among yourſelves, as theſe 3. laſt be wherein you differ from vs; notwithſtanding your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable courſe might thereby appeare vnto all, in holding ſuch communion among yourſelves as you deny in others: yet as if either partialitie were no blot, but a beautifull wart in the face of your Church: or els as if you diſpaired of waſhing away this blot, even ſo do you paſſe by this matter in ſilence without any reply vnto it.</p>
                  <p>VVhereas you put me in minde that I have not as yet alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:22760:181"/>any one word of God for our feſtivall dayes, mariage by the miniſter, conſiſtorie, and communion of our members with an other Church, &amp;c. I anſwer, that ſeing you are the accuſer, that maintaine a ſeparation from vs in theſe reſpects, the falt is yours that have not brought any word of God to conclude a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from vs vpon theſe grounds: Though in your Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie you have pretended ſcripture to ſhew ſome of theſe things vnlawfull, yet have you not directed any reaſons againſt our communion for theſe things: even as in your Apologie you have pretended ſcripture againſt our vſe of the Lords prayer, &amp; yet confeſſe that you would not ſeparate for this. As for our communion with England I have ſayd enough before Chap 4. &amp; 6. ſo far as concernes ſeparation from vs vpon ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. As for our conſiſtorie or Elderſhip, I ſhewed in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer writing how you have allowed it yourſelf in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therewith, and you have anſwered not a word vnto it. Now thoſe that refute themſelves on this maner, have no reaſon to call for further refutation, vnleſſe they acknowledge their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in ſuch practiſes.

As for the ſtate of the queſtion and what we hold in theſe matters, I have ſet it downe in my former writing, and to this poynt alſo you ſay nothing. Touching the other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt vs, which are here ambiguouſly repeated by you<pb n="331" facs="tcp:22760:181"/>and not ſo that the reader might well vnderſtand the meaning thereof, I am ready to manifeſt that I have not done you any wrong in the relation thereof; and that you cannot confirme any of them by the vvord of God: if you will bring any reaſons to conclude a ſeparation from thence.</p>

This might alſo tend vnto the honour of Chriſte, to have falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and falſe Chriſtians diſcovered, and might help the elect Iewes to bring them vnto true Chriſtians, and keep them from Antichriſte. Yea when the time of their viſitation is come, that the Iewes ſhalbe called and grafted in againe, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the differences among Chriſtians, may be a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to direct them vnto the truth: for the godly ſhall riſe by that thing vvhereat others ſtumble. 3, if it be an vnlawfull thing to publiſh the open and profeſſed differences of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, then is your ſin great in this behalf, as I have ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed already, and might eaſily bring an 100. more examples &amp; inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to prove the ſame: as for <hi>Iulian the apoſtata,</hi> though his apoſtaſy was the deeper, yet is he the glaſſe of your evill, &amp; you may name him and thinke of him with feare and trembling: for the number of apoſtaſyes, I think you cannot ſhew that he hath apoſtate and fallen from his profeſſion ſo often as you have done: and as for contempt of the Church of God and true Chriſtians, for which he is moſt infamous, I dare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to manifeſt that your ſeparation hath publiſhed more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and ſlanders of them, then you can ſhew that he hath done. 4.

                  <p>As for your counſell to me; it is ſuch as Chriſt Ieſus hath taught me not to embrace: for he hath taught vs to bevvare of errour, &amp; to knovv falſe teachers the better, by their ſcandalous and vvicked practiſes, vvhich he

                     <hi>Elias Levita</hi> hath reduced theſe divers readings, we may thereby plainely obſerve that they are all ſuch, as through ſome ſimilitude either in ſound, in figure, or in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or through tranſpoſition, coniunction, or diviſion of the letters, or the like occaſion the pen of the ſcribe might quickly ſlip and miſſe therein: for example to give inſtance in two like letters: he telles vs that <hi>in 52 places of theſe divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> jod <hi>is written in the beginning of a word, and the Maſorites will have it be read</hi> vau: <hi>And on the contra in 56. places</hi> vau <hi>is written in the beginning of a word and they read it</hi> jod: <hi>Againe in 70. places</hi> jod <hi>is written in the middes of a word and they read it &amp; pronounce it as</hi> vau, &amp;c.

                  <p>Secondly, though the <hi>Chaldee verſion</hi> do ſometimes follow that reading vvhich now ſtands in the margine: yet vvho can affirme that it ſtood in the margine of that copie which this paraphraſt then vſed, rather then in the text itſelf? The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites though coming after the <hi>Chaldee paraphraſt</hi> might finde divers copies of the ſcripture, differing one from an other: from theſe might they gather the divers readings, and to write ſome of them in the text, and ſome of them in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: even as many Printers of late, having gathered and noted <hi>divers readings</hi> from ſuch as vvere ancienter then themſelves, do now adde them to the margine of the new Teſtament.

                     <hi>law onely</hi> from theſe interpreters: and alledgeth this as a reaſon, why he vndertook a more full declaration of the Ievves ſtory. And this reaſon of his, is againſt their opinion alſo, vvho imagine that the reſt of the ſcriptures were tranſlated by other 72. interpreters in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> and the laſt <hi>Ptolemee</hi> for if the whole ſtorie of the old Teſtament had bene by ſuch a famous tranſlation of other <hi>Septuagints</hi> turned into Greek &amp; publiſhed vnto the world, then could not <hi>Ioſephus</hi> have alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this reaſon as a ſpeciall cauſe of his enterpriſe.

<hi>Septuagint</hi> as being approved in the new Teſtament, are quite beſide the matter; becauſe the moſt of theſe your inſtances are taken not from the law, but from other parts of ſcripture, vvhich according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> were not tranſlated by the ſeptuagint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the tranſlation of the ſeptuagint whether it was of the law onely, or of the whole ſcripture of the old Teſtament, <pb n="394" facs="tcp:22760:215"/>is much to be ſuſpected as an vnfaithfull and maimed work even from the firſt beginning thereof: ſeing divers

                  <p>The Iewes them ſelves confeſſe that this tranſlation of the law hath bene a burden vpon their conſciences; for which they do repent vnto this day <hi>R. Iaakob</hi> deſcribing the divers faſts which they obſerve, ech moneth in the yeare, ſaith that they faſt

                     <hi>in the eight day of the moneth Tebeth, becauſe then the law was written in Greek in the dayes of king</hi> Ptolaemeus <hi>and that there was darknes in the world for three dayes.</hi> This their practiſe is ſutable to their auncient envy againſt the gentiles, 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.21.22. And being ſo affected, it is the leſſe marvell, if they ſought to hide or change divers things in their tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that auncient tranſlation of the ſeptuagints doth not appeare at this day. Some think we have onely ſome frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof: and others think it to be quite loſt. Touching theſe opinions, <hi>D. Whitaker</hi>

And againe in the ſame place, after many corruptions noted in it, he ſaith we may thence conclude that either we have not this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 70 elders; or els that it is ſo infinitely and filthily corrupted, that it is now of very ſmall authoritie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as for that Greek tranſlation which is extant at this day, going vnder the name of the ſeptuagint, &amp; which you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo much and alledge ſo often, it appeares evidently to be a moſt corrupt thing, full offorgeries, and ſwarming with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:22760:215"/>over all from the beginning to the end of it. All good writers at this day do generally vpon occaſion vvitneſſe ſo much. In ſpeciall there is one
<note n="“" place="margin">Engel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in proaem. pentaglott. val. Schind.</note> learned man who hath taken paines to ſet downe ſome generall heads &amp; as it were ſtanderds vnder which thoſe troopes and legions of errour and falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be in ſome part reduced and marſhalled. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers examples he ſhewes of ſeverall kindes, and yet vnto ech kinde more inſtances might be added: yea and more generall heads of ſuch errours be deſcribed alſo. Many witneſſe that it was corrupt of old: but for this time preſent, the corruptions are vnſpeakable and without number: and more alſo then the corruptions of <hi>Onkelos and Ionathan</hi> the Chaldee paraphraſts, &amp; therfore alſo of leſſe authoritie though you in your compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon affirme the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> as the errours of this Greek tranſlation are for number many: ſo are they for the nature of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very great. Some of them do directly contradict the text as in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105.2.8.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 26.32. in the firſt place affirming what the ſcripture denyes, &amp; in the later de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that which God affirmes in his word. They impugne the truth of the holy ſtory, in deſcribing the yeares of ſundry pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, eſpecially by giving ſo many yeares vnto Methuſchelah as if he had lived 14. yeares after the flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. In ſtead of 40. they put 3 dayes, <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. That moſt abſurd fable of the Iewes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the play with Leviatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is countenaced by this tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſeptuagint Pſ. 104.26. The moſt impious errour of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rians denying the eternall godhead of Chriſt, doth alſo receive ſtrength from this corrupt verſion, whiles they tranſlate <hi>Prov. 8.22. he hath created me in the beginning of his wayes:</hi> in ſtead of <hi>he hath poſſeſſed me,</hi> as though Chriſte were but a mere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In reſpect of theſe forgeries, it is moſt vntrue which you ſay, of this Greek tranſlation, with the Chaldee: that they are <hi>both, of great authoritie.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphraſt tranſlateth that place of the Proverbs as the Greek hath it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> whereas you ſay, that <hi>the Apoſtles do ſo often follow not onely the words, but even the Theologicall expoſition</hi> of theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters;<pb n="396" facs="tcp:22760:216"/>this is alſo an vncertaine and vnwarrantable aſſertion for all the examples that you alledge who is it that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certainely prove ynto vs that the Apoſtles followed the ſeptuagint &amp; that thoſe corrupted Greek verſions of the old Yeſtament were not rather corrected according to the allegations of the Apoſtles in the new; Seing this tranſlation is generally ſuppoſed to be a patchery out of many; what hinders but that the correctours of the ſeptuagint, in later editions, might follow the words of the Apoſtles, &amp; that ſo by this meanes, that agreement of expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions words and phraſes which is betwixt them in ſome place might ariſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sevently,</hi> ſuppoſe the Apoſtles in their Greek writings did vſe the verſion of the ſeptuagint, in ſome allegations as being then beſt knowne there being few or none other tranſlations at that time, it doth not follow hence that it ſhould therfore be honoured above others in theſe times, when as there is not the like occaſion of writing in Greek; when as there are many other tranſlations extant more fit for vſe, and far freer from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> as for the tranſlations of <hi>Symmachus &amp; Theodotio,</hi> they being both of them heretiques and enimies of Chriſte, and one of them alſo an Apoſtate from Chriſtianity to Iudaiſme, yea &amp; ſince that time alſo their tranſlations being exceedingly corrupted, it ſkilles not much, whether the margine or the line, or both be followed and obſerved in the fragments of their Greek verſions. Their credit is far too weake to procure divine authoritie vnto both the divers readings which are in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites Bible, yea though they had plainely avouched the ſame, which yet is not ſhewed out of them: even by your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their tranſlation, they followed but one reading onely, and therfore their example, if it be ought worth, is againſt your ſelf, who deliver two vnto vs, and thoſe both as from the Lord.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, that they have no other ground then the Kabala or tradition of the Maſorites: Theſe and other ſuch like traditions they hold to be the ſtrength of the law and of divine warrant, and commended vnto vs by the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Elias Levita</hi> in his explication of the maſora or tradition ſings on this maner:

                  <p>Secondly, whereas on <hi>Gen. 33.4.</hi> you ſay.

                  <p>Thirdly, whereas vpon the word <hi>harlot</hi> in <hi>Gen.
34,31,</hi> you ſay: <hi>In the Hebrewe</hi> Zonah, <hi>the firſt letter is extraordinarily great, for ſome hidden meaning, What if it be, to ſignify the ſtout and big words of theſe yong men to their father? So a litle letter is vſed before in</hi> Gen. 23.2. <hi>to ſignify moderation without exceſſe in Abrahams weeping.</hi> Your coniecture for <hi>Zonah</hi> hath ſome colour, though a trifling vanity and without ground, but your aſſertion to countenance the ſame from the litle letter in <hi>Gen.
23.</hi> to ſignify moderation is a very vnreaſonable and abſurd ſpeculation. For what colour of reaſon is there, that a moderate ſorow ſhould be ſignifyed by an immoderately litle letter, that an ordinate affection ſhould be repreſented by an inordinate extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary token? if the big letter in <hi>Zonah</hi> note the fault of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſtout and big words in the yong men to their father: why ſhould not the letter in
<hi>BAcAH, WEpTE,</hi> wanting the due proportion and meaſure with the reſt, as wel note a defect and fault of the too litle ſorow in Abraham? The comparing of theſe two examples ſo vnequally oppoſed and miſmatched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather doth juſtly reprove and refute your collection from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas you pleaded
<note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 46</note> before, that the ſeparation of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cluſe</hi> your elder from the French church, was lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their <hi>preaching from humane apocryphal catechiſmes;</hi> even by the like reaſon may you ſee that your miniſtery alſo is to be forſaken and left, if you preach in your congregation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſcriptures in ſuch maner as you do here. For what are theſe extraordinary prickes, that you ſpeak of: theſe formes of great and litle letters in the middes of words and ſentences,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:22760:217"/>but humane apocryphall deviſes of Rabbines and Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diques? what divine warrant have you for them, and for your expounding of them and of <hi>Keri</hi> &amp; <hi>cethib,</hi> both togather in one place? It is ten times more lawfull to expound the principles of Chriſtian religion in Catechiſmes according to the maner of the French Churches, then to expound theſe Iewiſh fables and toyes in ſuch maner as you do. Theſe Iewiſh deviſes are
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 1 4. Tit. 1.13.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely condemned by the holy Ghoſt: th'other not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if the Lord by the finger of his ſpirit do direct vs to take ſpeciall obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe extraordinary prickes that you tell vs of in <hi>Gen. 33.4.</hi> to the end that we might ſearch out ſome hidden meaning therein: then are you againe guilty of great perfidie and vnfaithfullnes, which in your tranſlation and annotations alſo in other places do paſſe them over and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale thoſe parts of the ſcripture, where divine vvarnings of meditation are propounded vnto vs. For whereas there are fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene words noted by the ſcribes and by ſome printers to have ſuch prickes over their heads: five of them are by you already wrapt vp in darknes and paſſed over in ſilence, namely in <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.5. &amp;
18.9. and 19.33, and 37.12. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. In ech of theſe places, are theſe prickes to be ſeene, vvhich you omit with out giving any vvarning of them. So do you alſo paſſe by the litle letter in
<note n="“" place="margin">Annot. on Gen. 2 4.</note>
                     <hi>behibbarcam:</hi> the great letter in
<note n="*" place="margin">Annot. on Pſal. 80.13. &amp; verſ.
15.</note> 
                     <hi>Cannah,</hi> and the ſuſpended letter lifted vp in the word
<hi>jagnar,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe being of like regard by the tradition of the Maſorites, ought in like maner to have bene noted by you: and ſuppoſe you could not have ſhewed the reaſon of them in theſe places, yet ſhould you at leaſt have given warning of them vnto your readers and have left them to their conſideration. In like maner do you alſo paſſe by the
<hi>crownes</hi> of the ſpeciall letters which are ſo oft noted therewith in the lavv, of vvhich it is ſayd by <hi>R. Iudah,</hi> that
<note n="“" place="margin">Thalmud in Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choth cap. 3. Fol. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes on a certaine time aſcending on high, he found the holy bleſſed God binding crownes vpon the letters;</hi> to vvit, three for ech of the ſeven letters conteyned in the vvord
<hi>ſchagnatnazgats,</hi> as was noted
<note n="“" place="margin">Pag. 294</note> before. In the ſame place of the Thalmud it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<pb n="400" facs="tcp:22760:218"/>how the Lord foretold vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that after certaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there ſhould come a man eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Akibah be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ioſeph</hi> by name, who ſhould expound vnto vs all thoſe crownes, prickes and titles of the letters: that the Lord alſo at <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſt did ſhew that man vnto him: and that
<hi>Moſes</hi> in admiration of him did ſay, <hi>O Lord of the world haſt thou ſuch a man as this, and doſt thou deliver thy law by mine hand?</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>R. Akiba</hi> being come: and you being ſo familiar with theſe Talmudiſts, is it not wonder that you have nothing to ſay for our inſtruction, touching theſe crownes and miters, eſpecially there being the ſame Talmudique warrant to prove that they are divine, holy &amp; from God, as there is to prove <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>cethib,</hi> the divers readings to be both written by the ſpirit of God? VVhen the Lord ſhewed the patterne of the tabernacle and inſtruments thereof vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> he commanded him to make
<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 25 11.24.25. &amp; 30.3.</note> limbes or crownes of gold for the arke, the table and altar of incenſe: &amp; it had bene great vnfaithfulnes in <hi>Moſes</hi> to have neglected the ſame. Now the frame of the holy ſcriptures is as precious and excellent as was the forme of the tabernacle: if therfore thoſe prickes over ſpeciall wordes belong vnto them of right as their crownes, then is your vnfaithfulnes in the houſe of God, great in your omitting of them.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Iew doctours, they plot with theſe prickes a Crovvne of thornes for the head of the Lord directly contrary vnto the letter and ſenſe of the ſcripture: as in <hi>Gen. 19.33.</hi> where it is ſayd of <hi>Lot</hi> touching his eldeſt daughter, that he perceyved not, neither when ſhe lay downe, nor <hi>when ſhe roſe vp:</hi> becauſe of the prick that crowneth the vvord <hi>roſe,</hi>
                     <note n="%" place="margin">Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud de nazir. cap. 4. P.
23.</note> they gather and teach that though he perceyved her not when ſhe lay downe, yet he percevved her when ſhe roſe vp. VVhere it is ſayd in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.12. they went to feed <hi>the flock,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe of the prick over the word <hi>the, R. Solomon</hi>
                     <note n="“" place="margin">Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. on theſe places.</note> gathers that they went not but to feed themſelves. In
<hi>Numb.</hi> 3.39. becauſe of the crowne, of prickes over the word
<hi>Aaron,</hi> R. Sol. gathers that <hi>Aaron</hi> was not in the number of the Levites. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.<pb n="401" facs="tcp:22760:218"/>becauſe of the prickes over the words, <hi>to vs and to our Children</hi> the ſame Rabbine teacheth that Iſrael was not vrged to do the things revealed vntill they had paſſed over <hi>Iorden</hi> &amp; taken vpon them the oth in mount
<hi>Gerizim,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>ANother curioſitie of much like nature with the former is, when according to the maner of the Cabaliſts, you draw obſervations to illuſtrate your doctrine from the tranſpoſed letters of the ſcripture. As for example concerning <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> you
<note n="“" place="margin">Annot. on Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 38.7.</note> ſay thus: <hi>The letters in Hebrue of this word</hi> evil, <hi>and of his name</hi> Er, <hi>are the ſame, the order onely changed: the like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is before in Noes name and Grace, Gen. 6.8.</hi> I anſwer, 1. The letters of the ſcripture being thus tranſpoſed by men, are no ſcripture nor ground of inſtruction; if the order be onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is enough to change the whole ſenſe: if accidentally it come to paſſe in one or two wordes, that there is an agreement of ſenſe, yet in hundreds it falles out otherwiſe: and therfore there is no found collections or annotations to be made from ſuch a forged order of tranſpoſed letters. 2, though the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue letters that ſignify <hi>Evil,</hi> be the ſame with <hi>Er</hi> his name, yet the vowells differ, and they alſo make the ſignification differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: 3, ſutable vnto this curioſitie, is that preſumptuous aſſertion which in your annotations on the ſame verſe you make by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this

                  <p n="1">1. VVhy might you not as well have ſayd, that the later Iewes as well as the ancient Iewes, have ſtill an expectation of the recovery of this loſſe by Chriſte, namely of the garden of Eden, and of the tree of life, &amp;c. do not the Iewes that now live receive and approve the writings of theſe Rabbines here alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by you? how then do you ſhew any difference betwixt them in this poynt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How can you ſay by way of oppoſition, in comparing the later Iewes with the ancient, that <hi>now they are ignorant of Chriſte,</hi> ſeing the ancient Iewes were alſo ignorant of him? The
<hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee paraphraſt</hi> being of cheefeſt authoritie among all that are here alledged by you, was moſt ignorant of Chriſte: he knew not that Chriſte vvas come, but
<note n="%" place="margin">On Cant. 8.</note> writes of him as of one that ſhould come hereafter, though by conſent of all he lived after the death of Chriſte. And further he vvrites of <hi>two Chriſtes</hi> that are to come: for, expounding thoſe vvords in <hi>Cant. 4.5, and 7.3.

Though the Rabbines ſpeaking of the garden of Eden and of the tree of life, do therewithall mention the men of the reſurrection and the ſending of them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the hands of Angels: yet is this no token that they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood hereby <hi>the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> becauſe theſe blinde Doctours hold and teach that there is a double reſurrection, one in which the bodies of men ſhall be rayſed vp to live on earth againe at the coming of Meſſias: and an other at the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſhall be rayſed vp to live in the Kingdome of heaven.

In the world to come there is no eating or drinking, nor any other of the things, which the bodies of the Sonnes of Adam, have need of in this world: as ſitting and ſtanding and ſleep, and death &amp; ſorow and mirth and the like: ſo our ancient wiſemen have ſayd, In the world to come, there is no eating nor drinking nor vſe of mariage but the iuſt do ſit with their crownes vpon their heads, and have the fruition of the glory of the Maieſty of God.

A head work forbidden is, to plow or till the ground: vnder this article they condemne all digging, filling of ditches, watring of herbes, &amp;c. Therfore their Rabbines permit men to ſprinckle, their houſes or chambers vvith vvater, that the duſt be not rayſed, but forbid men to ſweep with beſomes: leaſt in ſweeping any clefts or holes like vnto litle ditches ſhould be filled vvith duſt. A work forbidden is, cutting downe of corne, and reaping: vnder this article they compriſe all pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of apples, dates, figges, gathering of beries. And therfore they permit men to eat apples or other fruits, if they will put their mouthes vnto them as they hang vpon the tree: but with the hand to pluck away an apple from the tree or berie from the buſh, that they vtterly condemne. Sowing corne on the Sabath is a head work forbidden: but vnder this alſo, they forbid men in giving of corne to hennes or the like creatures, to caſt any more graines of corne vnto them then they vvill be ſure to eate: for if any graines lighting vpon the earth where the raine<pb n="439" facs="tcp:22760:239"/>falles, ſhould hap to ſpring and grow, this ſhould then prove a great ſin, like to that of the huſbandman that ſowes his field on the Sabath day. To beare a burden vpon the Sabath is a capitall ſin: and herevpon they forbid men to weare pattins vpon the Sabath, as the maner of ſome is that are to walk through myerie and foule places: their reaſon is, though theſe ſeeme to cary a man: yet indeed he beares the burden of them when he lifts vp his feete and goes with them.</p>
                  <p>Killing of beaſts by butchers is vnlawfull on the Sabath: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they teach that if a flea be found leaping on the earth or on clothes it is not lawfull to take it on the Sabath, but if the flea bite, then it is lawfull to take it to remoove it and caſt it away, but not to kill it: but if it be a lowſe that may be killed. Yet on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> teacheth that vvhoſoever kills a lowſe vpon the Sabath, doth as much as if he ſhould kill a Camell.

R. Ioſe</hi> ſaith, that there be two Angelles, the one good, the other evill, which every Sabath day in the evening do lead ech man from the Synagogue to their houſe: where if theſe Angelles do finde the Sabath-candle burning, the table ſpread, and the bed prepared, then the good Angel ſayth; God grant, that the Sabath following, all things may be in this houſe ſo as now they are, wherevnto the evill Angell is conſtrayned to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> whether he will or not. On the contrary, if theſe two Angelles coming to the houſe, do finde the former things vnprepared, then the evill Angell ſaith, let all things be in this houſe the next Sabath, as now they are: wherevnto the good Angell is compelled to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> whether he will or not. The Rabbines ſay it is impoſſible for Chriſtians and others to keep the Sabath as the Iewes do, becauſe they want a ſoule which the Iewes have more then they. By vertue of this ſuperfluous ſoule, they ſay that the heart of the Iewes is enlarged to reioyce and to be glad and hereby they baniſh all cares and troubles out of their breaſts, and ſo keep the reſt of the Sabath.

But that they are not bound to this cup as to the foure former cups. And in fine, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:22760:243"/>theſe and ſome other of their traditions, you ſay further; <hi>Theſe obſervations of the Iewes whiles their common wealth ſtood, &amp; to this day: may give light to ſome particulars in the paſseover that Chriſt kept: as why they lay downe, one leaning on an others boſome, Ioh. 13.23. (a ſigne of reſt and ſecurity) and ſtood not as at the firſt paſſeover, neither ſate on high as we vſe. Why Chriſt roſe from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and waſhed and ſate downe againe, Ioh. 13.4.5.12. Why he bleſſed or gave thanks for the bread apart, and for the cup (or wine) apart, Mark. 14.22.23, and why it is ſayd, he took the cup after ſupper, Luk. 22.20. alſo concerning the Hymne which they ſung at the end, Mat. 26.30, &amp;c.</hi> But vve are here to conſider, that 1. It is vncertaine vvhether theſe vvere the obſervations of the Ievves vvhiles their common vvealth ſtood: The records of the Rabbines from whoſe mouth you ſpeak, are full of lyes, fictions, contradictions even for matters of fact and practiſe: and even for theſe particular obſervations here mentioned by you: if you deny it, I can bring you plentifull proof thereof: And how great folly is it, to ſtuff our expoſitions of the ſcripture with ſuch things as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can not be aſſured of the truth thereof?
2. Suppoſe the obſervations of the Iewes before Chriſte were ſuch as you in particular do relate: how vnworthily do you apply his holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution vnto their vaine inventions? Do you not make Chriſte Ieſus guilty of their ſuperſtitions and preſumptuous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions vnto the ordinance of God, as though framed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vnto their vnlawfull practiſes and followed the ſame? The light you boaſt of, is darknes, and not light. Theſe things which the Rabbines record are not according to the law and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie: &amp; whiles they ſpeak not according to that word, vvhat light
<note n="p" place="margin">Eſa. 8.20</note> is in them? The maner of Chriſts ſitting downe with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one an others boſome, was according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ordinary maner of their ſitting downe to meate at thoſe times as appeareth by the vſe of the

Luk. 7 37. &amp; 22.27.</note> like phraſe ſerving to deſcribe the ſame: and therfore was directly contrary to the ſuperſtition of the Iewes, that all other nights did eat ſitting or lying, that<pb n="447" facs="tcp:22760:243"/>night lying onely: and therfore a ſuperſtitious bondage.. As for Chriſts riſing from ſupper to vvaſh his diſciples feet: what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munity is there betwixt it &amp; the ſuperſtitious hand-waſhing of the Iewes? If our Saviour
<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 15.2, &amp;c.</note> had no regard of the phariſaicall waſhing of hands at other times; much leſſe had he regard to this invention in the worſhip of God and celebration of this ſacrament: yea it is impiety to think that he followed their faſhion either in this or in any of the like traditions. 3. The obſervations of the Iewes in keeping their paſſeover, according to the records of the Rabbines are ten times more then theſe that you have repeated: and they are of like nature, of like war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and authoritye, even from their owne braines: you might as vvel have repeated them alſo: as namely, The myſterie of the
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Arba Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim in Orach Chajim, ſig.
473, &amp;c</note> three cakes covered betwixt two napkins in a diſh; one which was higheſt repreſenting the high Prieſt: the middle moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the tribe of Levi: &amp; the loweſt repreſenting the whole people of Iſrael: a myſterie as worthy to be noted as that which you mention of the 4. cups, &amp;c. You might as wel have related the myſterie of their quiſhions then ſometimes leaned vpon, ſometimes not: their hiding of a peece of a cake vnder a napkin, to ſignify how their elders coming out of Egipt caried their dough vpon their ſhoulders bound in clothes, &amp;c. Some other of theſe traditions I noted before, in deſcribing their Idol-temple; and many more if need require may be brought forth for a teſtimony, how far they were from the right exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall practiſe of Moſes his ordinances. As for your notes vpon that
<note n="t" place="margin">Annot. on Exo. 13 9.</note> other place, which you ſend vs to look vpon tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Phylacteries: 1. vve finde there ſo much ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanitie recorded by yourſelf out of the Rabbines tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the maner, order, time and fruit of them, as may juſtly ſerve to reprove your owne aſſertion, touching the neceſſary help of ſuch recorders: It is wonder, that you beholding and conſidering their groſſe corrupting of Moſes ordinances in the externall practiſe thereof, are not yet aſhamed to affirme that many legall rites will not be well vnderſtood without their<pb n="448" facs="tcp:22760:244"/>help.

If Chriſtian men did ſee the volumes of dotages which the Thalmudiſts have written touching theſe phylacteries, they might thereby learne to beware of following you to ſeek the well vnderſtanding of Gods ordinances from ſuch blinde guides: But this I obſerve throughout your allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Rabbines that to win the more credit vnto your owne notes, you conceale the groſſeſt abſurdities of them, like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull merchant that to vent his wares conceales the greateſt faults thereof: Thus, the ſimple may be deceyved by you both. 3, that the place of the Evangeliſts Mat. 23, touching the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries which the Phariſees vvore, ſhould much be cleared by theſe Rabbinical records, as you pretend, it is but a bare aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And what preſumption is this, without warrant of ſcripture revealed to apply the names vnto the ſtones, contrary vnto the order of reckoning the tribes in every place? vvhat modeſt Chriſtian dare imitate you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. VVhereas you tell vs that the Greek tranſlation addeth, <hi>according to their generations:</hi> I have ſhewed before that the greek tranſlation which you alledge ſo oft in vaine, is a moſt corrupt, and forged thing abounding with many vnlawfull &amp; preſumptuous additions, ſubtractions and alterations of the holy text, and therfore we ought not to build expoſitions ſo boldly vpon the credit and authority of ſuch a falſe and decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable tranſlation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it had bene expreſſed in the text, that the names of the tribes: had bene engraven vpon theſe ſtones according to their generations: yet doth it not follow that they ſhould be engraven according to the order, which you do here ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily avouch and demonſtrate in this table; for if the order according to the time of their birth be preciſely followed, then are they to be reckoned as in <hi>Gen. 29, &amp; 30,</hi> and then ſhould the Children of the handmayds be ſet before Iſſachar &amp; Zabulon, contrary to this your order: if the time of their birthes be followed in ſome part and meaſure, yet ſo as reſpect be had vnto the dignity of Leah and Rachel above their maydes, then might the order of

                  <p>But for the eſtabliſhing of this your aſſertion, you tell vs in<pb n="459" facs="tcp:22760:251"/>the ſame
<note n="b" place="margin">Annot. on Exo. 28.21.</note> place, that <hi>This order of names is before ſhewed out of the Ieruſalemy Thargum:</hi> The teſtimony of this Thargum you propound vnto vs and very carefully ſet before our eyes

                  <p>Herevnto I anſwer, 1. The teſtimony of this fabulous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is of no worth, being full of vnwarrantable preſumptions, fables, errours and moſt groſſe abſurdities. In the firſt ſection of Geneſis, this Thargum ſaith, that <hi>Two thouſand yeares before the world was created, God created the law, and prepared Hell and the garden of Eden, &amp;c.</hi> On <hi>Exod. 1.</hi> this Thargum ſaith of
<hi>Shiphrah</hi> the midwife, that ſhe was <hi>Iochebed;</hi> and of
<hi>Puah,</hi> that ſhe vvas <hi>Miriam;</hi> that theſe women fearing God got them a good name in the reſt of the generations, and built them houſes,
<hi>the houſe of the Levites, and the houſe of the great Prieſthood:</hi> This Ieruſalem paraphraſt on <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. confirmes the fable of Eſaw his biting Iaakob by the neck, as was noted before, and ſaith that both wept, <hi>Eſaw</hi> becauſe his teeth vvere ſet on edge, and
<hi>Iaakob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his neck was become Marble. This ſame Thargum on
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. telleth vs, how the glory of God vvas revealed on Mount
<hi>Seir</hi> to give the law to the ſonnes of <hi>Eſaw:</hi> but when they found written therein <hi>ye ſhall not kill,</hi> they vvould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave it. That then this glory ſhined on the mount of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to deliver this law vnto the ſonns of <hi>Iſmael:</hi> but vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they found vvritten therein <hi>ye ſhall not ſteale,</hi> they would not receive it. That then the glory of God returned and vvas revealed on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with millions of holy Angels: That then <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſayd, whatſoever the vvord of the Lord ſaith, we vvill do it and will receyve it, &amp;c. And with a multitude of ſuch like fabulous matters is that Thargum full ſtuffed: when you feed your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with allegations of ſuch authors, you may fill their bellies with gravel and aſhes, and choake them in ſtead of nouriſhing<pb n="460" facs="tcp:22760:252"/>them. And a heap of ſuch vanities are in the ſame, which ſhew the vnſoundnes thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even in that very place which you alledge is there appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and manifeſt errour in expounding the ſtones of the breaſt plate: and to omit others, this is to be obſerved in the two laſt ſtones, which this Thargum tranſlates, <hi>Bedoicha &amp; margalitha; Bdelium &amp; a pearle:</hi> and herein contradicteth your tranſlation: By this Thargum,
<hi>Beniamins</hi> name ſhould not be engraven vpon the <hi>Iaſper,</hi> as you would have it: If you think the Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum to be erroneous in this poynt, why do you follow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of it in an other which is vttred as it vvere vvith the ſame breath in the expoſition of the ſame verſe touching order of the names?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againſt this Thargum Ieruſalemy, I may oppoſe the Thalmud Ieruſalemy: though neither of them be indeed of any worth, yet of you they are much eſteemed and oft alledged; and of the Iewes this Thalmud is the more reſpected. In
<note n="e" place="margin">Thalmud Ieruſalemy in Sotah Fol. 21. B.</note> it, among the opinions of other Rabbines, according to that vvhich I noted before out of the Babylonian Thalmud, the opinion of <hi>R. Zabida</hi> is recorded, touching the names in the Ephod, that <hi>the firſt were not written according to the order</hi> (of their birth) <hi>becauſe Iehudah was King, but the later were written according to the order.</hi> And ſo if, (as you affirme) the ſame order of engraving was obſerved both on the two ſhoulder ſtones and on the 12 in the breaſtplate, then this Thalmud Ieruſalemy affordes vs an order contrary to you and to your Thargum Ieruſalemy.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for confirmation of the order deſcribed by you; you alledge that
<note n="f" place="margin">Annot. on Exo. 28 21.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſame is alſo expreſsed by the Chaldee paraphraſt on</hi> Song. 5.14.
<hi>where ſpeaking of the 12 tribes engraved on 12 precious ſtones, he nameth them thus: 1, Reuben, 2 Symeon, 3 Levi, 4 Iudah, 5 Iſsachar, 6 Zabulon, 7 Dan, 8 Naphtali, 9 Gad, 10 Aſher, 11 Ioſeph, 12 Beniamin: who were like to the 12. celeſtiall ſignes, bright as lamps, and poliſhed in their works like yvorie, and ſhining like Saphirs.</hi> I anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Chaldee paraphraſe of <hi>R. Ioſeph Caecus</hi> (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<pb n="461" facs="tcp:22760:252"/>taken,) I have
<note n="“" place="margin">Pag. 390.</note> already ſhewed to be moſt fabulous ſuperſtitious and erroneous, a fit match to be alledged as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with your Thargum Ieruſalemy; neither of them being of any credit: vpon the words of the former Chapter, <hi>Song. 4.6 vntill the day break and ſhadowes flee away,</hi> &amp;c. this paraphraſt ſpeakes like a charmer or Magician ſhewing vs a diſtinction of devilles, making ſome to be <hi>night ſpirits,</hi> ſome <hi>morning ſprights,</hi> and ſome <hi>noone ſprights:</hi> as alſo away of putting them to flight by the ſmel of the perfume in the ſanctuary: not much vnlike to the

The expoſitions which this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt gives on ech chapter of this Song, are a pregnant proofe of the authors inſufficiency to be allowed as a witneſs in theſe controverſies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To go no further then this paraphraſe on this verſe which you alledge; vve may here obſerve how he erreth in the expoſition of the ſtones, in making the ſeventh to be a Beryll &amp; the eight a ſaphir, manifeſtly contrary to the text, &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to you alſo: Had you fully ſet downe your allegation, as you do a part thereof; had you noted how this paraphraſt tranſlates the ſtones, ſo as you do his naming of the tribes, then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might eaſily have perceived either your authors errour, or els the refutation of yourſelf by his words cited in this place. But you did wiſely to leave out that which is againſt yourſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This paraphraſt in this ſame place alledged, ſaith that the names of <hi>the three Fathers of the world, Abraham, Iſaac and Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob were engraven togather with the twelve tribes:</hi> Thus alſo it is recorded in both the
<note n="h" place="margin">Thalmud Babylon. in joma, c. 7. Fol.
73. Thalmud Ieruſalemy in joma Fol. 44.</note> Thalmud, viz. for ſo much as the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Tſadi</hi> &amp; <hi>Koph</hi> were not found in the names of the 12 tribes in the breaſtplate, therfore as <hi>R. Samuel</hi> ſaith, the names of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaakob were written above the names of the tribes in the breaſt plate; and becauſe there wants alſo the letter
<hi>Teth</hi> in thoſe 12 names, therfore as <hi>R. Acha</hi> ſaith there was written vnder them, <hi>ſchibte jeſchurun:</hi> or as <hi>R. Moſes</hi> Mikkotſi

Seing theſe be their bold aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who would not be afraid to take the teſtimony of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumptuous Rabbines? And much more ought every miniſter of Chriſt to be aſhamed to alledge their teſtimonies in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the ſcriptures, whiles with one breath they do at the ſame time ſend forth ſuch vnſound fancies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our great partialitie in alledging theſe Rabbines is an other mayne offence in you; &amp; this appeares in divers kindes:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, betwixt yourſelf and oppoſites; you are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in blaming them ſo much for vſing the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men, whiles yourſelf do vſe them far more frequently: you have often complained of me for making fleſh my arme in alledging the authoritie of men againſt you: even when I did it not, as hath bene ſhewed
<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 45.47.50.</note> before. Herein you ſeeme to be like vnto that famous vſurer who rejoyced to heare that ſin of vſury reproved, condemned and publiquely preached againſt: in hope that others thereby would vſe it the leſſe, that he might vſe it the more and have the more cuſtomers for his intereſt: but you are in this vnlike him and more blame-worthy, in that he onely reioyced to ſee others condemne it, whereas you your ſelf do often and openly condemne a practiſe, in the middes of your owne moſt immoderate vſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the authors alledged you are very partial; whiles you alledge Infidels rather then the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtians endued with the ſpirit of wiſedome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: yea ſo far that in your annotations even in Geneſis &amp; Exodus alone you have alledged theſe Iewiſh writers more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thouſand times in exact number, whereas among them all I finde not the name of one Chriſtian vvriter from the Apoſtles time vnto our age once alledged by you. But to prevent this blame you ſay,
<note n="b" place="margin">Preface to Annot. on Geneſis.</note>
                     <hi>The Chriſtian Fathers and Doctours becauſe they are vſually cited by other expoſitors abundantly: I thought needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete: and the rather for brevitie, which is requiſite in annotations.</hi> But againſt this excuſe it is to be obſerved, 1. that as for the heathniſh writers though they be as vſually cited by other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours, and though they be as commonly knowne as the Chriſtian Fathers and Doctours, yet you do very often alledge<pb n="472" facs="tcp:22760:258"/>them, and repeat the common allegations of them formerly vſed by others and finde place enough for them among your annotations: ſhould not the Chriſtian writers therfore at leaſt have had as much honour as they, in your allegations? 2, you do alſo alledge and repeate many Iewiſh teſtimonies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alledged by others: If need be I can ſhew you manifold inſtances in your annotations; ſo that you had no cauſe vpon this pretenſe of rarenes to have alledged them ſo much: there being many excellent obſervations of ſome Chriſtian vvriters that are far more rare and vnknowne then ſundry of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical teſtimonies alledged by you. 3, though ſundry of your Thalmudique teſtimonies be not commonly knowne, yet ſeing the moſt of them are vnproffitable, vaine traditions and fabulous matters: it had bene more proffit for the Chriſtian readers, and a greater help for their vnderſtanding of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to have alledged ſome of the beſt Chriſtian writers in ſtead of ſome of the worſt of thoſe Rabbines. 4, it is to be obſerved, that though you glory in the name of a Rabbine for every trifeling allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which you bring from them, yet when by ſtealth you
<note n="c" place="margin">Annot. on Gen. 37.35</note> alledge the rare obſervations of ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as that of <hi>Hades</hi> derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> and divers others: then do you conceale the names of the authors as if you were aſhamed to learne or borow anything from them, you being ſeparate from ſuch a ſociety in the Church of God as they all embraced.</p>
                  <p>Herein you ſeeme to be like vnto the Iewes, who though they have their ſet forme of prayer or bleſſings which they vſe at the lighting of Candles; yet their canon is,
<note n="d" place="margin">R. Alphes in Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth, cap. 8 Fol.
42.</note> that they may not bleſſe for the candle which they light at the candle of the gentiles or of Chriſtians: ſo you, when you light your candle at the Iewes, in alledging any thing from them, as if there were ſpecial cauſe of bleſſing for it, your maner is to give them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles of <hi>Hebrew Doctours, Iew Doctours, Ancient Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> &amp;c. and not onely that but without regard of that brevitie which you pretend, your maner is to alledge their teſtimonies<pb n="473" facs="tcp:22760:258"/>at large with the ſuperfluous and vaine titles they aſſume vnto themſelves, viz. <hi>our ancient wiſe men: our Rabbines of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,</hi> &amp;c. But on the contrary when you light your candle at the Chriſtians, in expounding the ſcriptures, you ſmother their names in ſilence, as if you were aſhamed of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, even towards the Rabbines themſelves you are very partiall, in alledging divers of the worſt ſort far oftener, then thoſe which are more proffitable among them. <hi>Aben Ezra, R. David Kimchi, Ralbag or R. Levi ben Gerſom,</hi> which have take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great paines to expound the words and phraſes in the text of the ſcripture, whoſe writings are far more proffitable then thoſe of <hi>Maimony,</hi> that ſpent his time moſt in expounding the Thalmud and the vaine traditions thereof, are yet very ſeldome alledged by you. Others that are not half ſo judicious and far more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous writings, as <hi>R. Menachem, R. Eliezer, R. Bechai, the Thalmud, the Zohar, Tanchuma, Bereſhith Rabba, Elleſhemoth rabba, &amp;c.</hi> being the maine fountaines of blind ſuperſtition and the greateſt corrupters of Gods ordinances have moſt honour given vnto them by you. As for <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> whom in ſpecial you reckon to be one of
<note n="e" place="margin">Annot. on Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 14.18.</note> 
                     <hi>the beſt and moſt ancient Hebrue Doctours,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pirkei</hi> are often alledged by you: how many of his obſervations or teſtimonies be there, even of the beſt that you could chooſe and pick out of all his vvritings that are worthy to be recorded?

<note n="n" place="margin">On Gen. 29.10.</note> 
                     <hi>as a mighty strong man rolled away the ſtone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the welles mouth, &amp;c. that the ſheepheardes ſaw it and wondred all: and were not able to rolle away the ſtone, but Iaakob rolled it away himſelf alone:</hi> that Iaakobs ſinew being touched:
<note n="o" place="margin">On Gen. 32.32.</note> 
                     <hi>it became like the fat of a dead thing: therfore it is vnlawfull for the ſonns of Iſrael to eat of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> &amp;c. that the
<note n="p" place="margin">On Gen. 37.15.</note> man which met Ioſeph in the field was <hi>the Angel Gabriel,</hi> called in Dan. 9.21.
<hi>the man Gabriel:</hi> that of the 20 ſhekels of ſilver for which Ioſeph was ſold,
<note n="q" place="margin">On Gen. 37.28.</note> 
                     <hi>every of the ten Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, had two ſhekels to buy ſhooes for their feet.</hi> Theſe as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are the beſt obſervations which you could finde in the beſt of the Rabbines: the choyſe of the choyſe: And yet of them all there is not one of them free from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And cannot the holy ſcriptures be well vnderſtood without theſe forgeries? In ſtead of theſe fictions you might have brought far more proffitable annotations from <hi>Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Kimchi &amp; Ralbag</hi> before mentioned touching the words and phraſes of ſcripture: but you prefer the worſt, &amp; give leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto the beſt of them. It is true indeed that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fables alſo recorded in theſe Rabbines, as I ſhewed
<note n="r" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> before yet are they but drops in compariſon of that flood of errour, preſumption and curioſitie which is to be found in others of your moſt honoured Thalmudiſts: And as is obſerved by
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioa. Rain. cenſura. lib. apocr. tom. 1. praelec. 77.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers touching <hi>Kimchi,</hi> ſo is it plaine for the other two alſo, that the fables rehearſed by them are not ſet downe as their owne aſſertions, but ordinarily in the name of others.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in the writings of one and the ſame Rabbine you ſeeme to deale partially: The ſuperſtitious <hi>Miſhneh</hi> of
<hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is moſt frequently alledged by you: but his <hi>Morch Nebuchim</hi> which is of far better vſe is ſcarſely touched by you in one or two allegations. This later work of his, being made long after
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:22760:259"/>his <hi>Miſhneh,</hi> though full of Rabbinical vanitie, yet is not like to his former: in ſo much that the Iewes of France, as ſome do
<note n="t" place="margin">Nebienſis in Octaplo. Annot. in Pſal. 68.</note> record, did themſelves burne this his book becauſe it ſeemed too much to favour the doctrine and profeſſion of Chriſtians.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>TO conclude, as theſe things do ſerve for a Glaſſe of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in alledging the Rabbines: ſo the due conſideration of the Iewiſh errours here noted vpon occaſion of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, may juſtly ſerve for a Glaſſe of Gods moſt ſevere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Iſrael, that we may juſtify and glorify him in the ſame. Hereby we ſee the
<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 8.12</note> Children of the Kingdome bound hand and foote in the cords of theſe errours and caſt out into the vtter darknes of obſtinate infidelitie, ſuperſtition and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. Hereby we ſee the truth of Gods word, in the preſent wrath that lyes vpon them according to the ancient propheſies
<note n="w" place="margin">Pſ. 69.23. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 11.10</note> for blinding of their eyes and bowing downe their backes. Hereby we ſhould learne to kiſſe the ſonne leaſt he be angry, and to hearken to the voyce of Chriſt in his Goſpel, whiles it is called to day; when as we ſee the contempt thereof to be ſo fearefully avenged on this elect nation, by giving them vp ſo long a time vnto ſuch horrible deluſions, and by ſcattring ſome of them into all quarters, (even as the
<note n="“" place="margin">Iud. 19.29.</note> Levites concubine cut into many pieces and ſent abroad) that all the people of the earth might ſee and know the work of God vpon them for their dayly inſtruction. Hereby we may alſo learne to be touched with the miſeries of this nation, holy in the root and ſtill beloved for the fathers ſake. As

                     <hi>Have ye no regard, all ye that paſſe by the way?
